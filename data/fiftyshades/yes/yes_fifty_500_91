"and , grasping each of my ankles , quickly jerks my legs apart and crawls onto the bed between my legs. He hovers over me. I am squirming with need . * Keep still , * he murmurs , and then he leans down and kisses the inside of my thigh , trailing kisses up , over the thin lacy material of my panties , kissing me . Oh * I can * t keep still. How can I not move ? I wriggle beneath him . * We * re going to have to work on keeping you still , baby. * He trails kisses up my belly , and his tongue dips into my navel. Still he * s heading north , kissing me across my torso. My skin is burning. I * m flushed , too hot , too cold , and I * m clawing at the sheet beneath me. He lies down beside me and his hand trails up from my hip , to my waist , and up to my breast. He gazes down at me , his expression unreadable , and gently cups my breast . * You fit my hand perfectly , Anastasia , * he murmurs , and dips his index finger into the cup of my bra and gently yanks it down , freeing my breast , but the underwire and fabric of the cup force it upward.

I am so wet. Oh , please , I beg internally as my fingers clasp the sheet tighter. His lips close around my other nipple , and when he tugs , I nearly convulse . * Let * s see if we can make you come like this , * he whispers , continuing his slow , sensual assault. My nipples bear the delicious brunt of his deft fingers and lips , setting alight every single nerve ending so that my whole body sings with sweet agony. He just doesn * t stop . * Oh * please , * I beg , and I pull my head back , my mouth open as I groan , my legs stiffening. Holy hell , what * s happening to me ? * Let go , baby , * he murmurs. His teeth close round my nipple , and his thumb and finger pull hard , and I fall apart in his hands , my body convulsing and shattering into a thousand pieces. He kisses"
