"remains elusive. Christian Grey is sitting on my bed . * I wondered what your bedroom would look like , * he says . I glance around it , plotting an escape route. No * there * s still only the door or window. My room is functional but cozy * sparse white wicker furniture and a white iron double bed with a patchwork quilt , made by my mother when she was in her folksy Americana quilting phase. It * s all pale blue and cream . * It * s very serene and peaceful in here , * he murmurs. Not at the moment * not with you here . Finally , my medulla oblongata recalls its purpose. I breathe. * How * ? * He smiles at me. * I * m still at the Heathman. * I know that . * Would you like a drink ? * Politeness wins out over everything else I * d like to say . * No thank you , Anastasia. * He smiles a dazzling , crooked smile , his head cocked slightly to one side . Well , I might need one . * So , it was nice knowing me ? * Holy cow , is he offended ? I stare down at my fingers. How am I going to dig myself out of this ? If I tell him it was a joke , I don * t think he * ll be impressed . * I thought you * d reply by e-mail. * My voice is small , pathetic . * Are you biting your lower lip deliberately ? * he asks darkly . I blink up at him , gasping , freeing my lip . * I wasn * t aware I was biting my lip , * I murmur softly . My heart is pounding. I can feel that pull , that delicious electricity between us charging , filling the space with static. He * s sitting so close to me , his eyes dark smoky gray , his elbows resting on his knees , his legs apart. Leaning forward , he slowly undoes one of my pigtails , his fingers freeing my hair. My breathing is shallow , and I can not move. I watch hypnotized as his hand moves to my second pigtail , and pulling the hair tie , he loosens the braid with his long , skilled fingers . * So you decided on some exercise , * he breathes , his voice soft and melodious. His fingers gently tuck my hair behind my ear. * Why , Anastasia ? * His fingers circle my ear , and very softly , rhythmically , he tugs my earlobe. It * s so sexual . * I needed time to think , * I whisper. I * m all deer/headlights , moth/flame , bird/snake * and he knows exactly what he * s doing to me . * Think about"
