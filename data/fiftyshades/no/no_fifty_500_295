"nothing in response. It * s five in the morning in Seattle ; hopefully he * s still asleep and not up playing mournful laments on his piano . * * * THE BEAUTY OF CARRY-ON rucksacks is that one can breeze out of the airport and not wait endlessly for baggage at the carousels. The beauty of traveling first class is that they let you off the plane first . My mom is waiting with Bob , and it is so good to see them. I don * t know if it * s because of exhaustion , the long journey , or the whole Christian situation , but as soon as I * m in my mother * s arms , I burst into tears . * Oh , Ana , honey. You must be so tired. * She glances anxiously at Bob . * No , Mom , it * s just * I * m so pleased to see you. * I hug her tightly . She feels so good and welcoming , like home. Reluctantly , I relinquish her , and Bob gives me an awkward one-armed hug. He seems unsteady on his feet , and I remember that he * s hurt his leg . * Welcome back , Ana. Why you cryin * ? * he asks . * Aw , Bob , I * m just pleased to see you , too. * I stare up into his handsome square-jawed face and his twinkling blue eyes that gaze at me fondly. I like this husband , Mom. You can keep him. He takes my backpack . * Jeez , Ana , what have you got in here ? * That would be the Mac , and they both put their arms around me as we head for the parking lot . I always forget how unbearably hot it is in Savannah. Leaving the cool air-conditioned confines of the arrival terminal , we step into the Georgia heat like we * re wearing it. Whoa ! It saps everything. I have to struggle out of Mom and Bob * s embrace so I can remove my hoodie. I am so glad I packed shorts. I miss the dry heat of Las Vegas sometimes , where I lived with Mom and Bob when I was seventeen , but this wet heat , even at 8 : 30 in the morning , takes some getting used to. By the time I * m in the back of Bob * s wonderfully air-conditioned Tahoe SUV , I feel limp , and my hair has started a frizzy protest at the heat. In the back of the SUV , I quickly text Ray , Kate , and Christian : * Arrived safely in Savannah. A : ) * My thoughts stray briefly to Jos * as I press * send , * and through the fog of my fatigue , I remember that his show is next"
