"momentarily stupefied , trying to assimilate this morsel of information. He * s bought me clothes. I roll my eyes in an exaggerated fashion , knowing full well he can * t see me. Car , phone , computer * clothes , it * ll be a damn condo next , and then I really will be his mistress . Ho ! My subconscious has her snarky face on. I ignore her and make my way upstairs toward my room. So , it is still mine * why ? I thought he * d agreed to let me sleep with him. I suppose he * s not used to sharing his personal space , but then , neither am I. I console myself with the thought that at least I have somewhere to escape from him . Examining the door , I find that it has a lock but no key. I wonder briefly if Mrs. Jones has a spare. I * ll ask her. I open the closet door and close it again quickly. Holy crap * he * s spent a fortune. It resembles Kate * s * so many clothes hanging neatly on the rail. Deep down , I know that they * ll all fit. But I have no time to think about that * I have to get kneeling in the Red Room of * Pain * or Pleasure , hopefully * this evening . KNEELING BY THE DOOR , I am naked except for my panties. My heart is in my mouth. Jeez , I thought after the bathroom he would have had enough. The man is insatiable , or maybe all men are like him. I have no idea , no one to compare him to. Closing my eyes , I try to calm myself down , to connect with my inner sub. She * s there somewhere , hiding behind my inner goddess . Anticipation runs bubbling like soda through my veins. What will he do ? I take a deep , steadying breath , but I can not deny it , I * m excited , aroused , wet already. This is so * I want to think wrong , but somehow it * s not. It * s right for Christian. It * s what he wants * and after the last few days * after all he * s done , I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants , whatever he thinks he needs . The memory of his look when I came in this evening , the longing in his face , his determined stride toward me like I was an oasis in the desert. I * d do almost anything to see that look again. I press my thighs together at the delicious memory , and it reminds me that I need to spread my knees. I shuffle them apart. How long will he make me wait ? The wait is crippling"
