"* I don * t do romance. My tastes are very singular. You should steer clear of me. * He closes his eyes as if in defeat. * There * s something about you , though , and I * m finding it impossible to stay away. But I think you * ve figured that out already. * My appetite vanishes. He can * t stay away ! * Then don * t , * I whisper . He gasps , his eyes wide. * You don * t know what you * re saying. * * Enlighten me , then. * We sit gazing at each other , neither of us touching our food . * You * re not celibate , then ? * I breathe . Amusement lights up his eyes . * No , Anastasia , I * m not celibate. * He pauses for this information to sink in , and I flush scarlet. The mouth-to-brain filter is broken again. I can * t believe I * ve just said that out loud . * What are your plans for the next few days ? * he asks , his voice low . * I * m working today , from midday. What time is it ? * I panic suddenly . * It * s just after ten ; you * ve plenty of time. What about tomorrow ? * He has his elbows on the table , and his chin is resting on his long , steepled fingers . * Kate and I are going to start packing. We * re moving to Seattle next weekend , and I * m working at Clayton * s all this week. * * You have a place in Seattle already ? * * Yes. * * Where ? * * I can * t remember the address. It * s in the Pike Market District. * * Not far from me. * He smiles. * So what are you going to do for work in Seattle ? * Where is he going with all these questions ? The Christian Grey Inquisition is almost as irritating as the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition . * I * ve applied for some internships. I * m waiting to hear. * * Have you applied to my company as I suggested ? * I flush * Of course not. * Um * no. * * And what * s wrong with my company ? * * Your company or your company ? * I smirk . * Are you smirking at me , Miss Steele ? * He tilts his head to one side , and I think he looks amused , but it * s hard to tell. I flush and glance down at my unfinished breakfast. I can * t look him in the eye when he uses that tone of voice . * I * d like to bite that lip , * he whispers darkly ."
