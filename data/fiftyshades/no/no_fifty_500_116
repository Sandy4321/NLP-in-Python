"and dress quickly. But if there * s one thing I hate , it * s not wearing clean panties. I rifle through Christian * s chest of drawers and come across his boxer briefs. After pulling on a pair of tight gray Calvin Kleins , I tug on my jeans and my Converse . Grabbing my jacket , I dash into the bathroom and stare at my too-bright eyes , my flushed face * and my hair ! Holy crap * just-fucked pigtails do not suit me , either.

I * d forgotten that . * So you are graduating this week ? * Grace asks . * Yes. * My cell phone starts ringing. Kate , I bet . * Excuse me. * It * s in the kitchen.
