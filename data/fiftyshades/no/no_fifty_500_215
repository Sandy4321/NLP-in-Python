"heart of hearts I know this is true. I turn into my pillow and the sluice gates open * and for the first time in years , I am sobbing uncontrollably into my pillow . I am momentarily distracted from my dark night of the soul by Kate shouting . * What the fuck do you think you * re doing here ? * * Well , you can * t ! * * What the fuck have you done to her now ? * * Since she * s met you she cries all the time. * * You can * t come in here ! * Christian bursts into my bedroom and unceremoniously switches on the overhead light , making me squint . * Jesus , Ana , * he mutters.
