# NLP-in-Python

Intro to some NLP concepts and libraries in Python for a class at CMU,
Feb 2015.

Lots of libraries are required - see [here](Installation.md) for install info.

Notebook viewer links:

[0. Reading in Files](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/NLP-in-Python/blob/master/0.%20Reading%20Files.ipynb): How I made the data files, mostly Gutenberg operations. Add your own URLs!

[1. Tokenizing, Stemming, POS](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/NLP-in-Python/blob/master/1.%20Tokenizing%2C%20Stemming%2C%20POS.ipynb) - the very basics. POS is "parts of speech" not "piece of %#@t".

[2. Wordclouds](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/NLP-in-Python/blob/master/2.%20WordClouds.ipynb) - entirely optional, but shows off interactive widgets to live-filter stopwords for visual effect

[3. TF-IDF, Clustering, Pattern](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/NLP-in-Python/blob/master/3.%20TF-IDF%2C%20Clustering%2C%20Pattern.ipynb) - getting to the meat!

Doing some TF-IDF NLP in node's package "natural" (but caveats apply): [see here](utils/booksNodeTfIdf.js)

[4. Naive Bayes Classification](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/NLP-in-Python/blob/master/4.%20Naive%20Bayes%20Classification.ipynb) - the infamous 50 Shades Sex Scene Detection because spam is boring

[5. Naive Bayes in Scikit-Learn](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/arnicas/NLP-in-Python/blob/master/5.%20Naive%20Bayes%20in%20Scikit-Learn.ipynb) - very quick intro to the main ml package in Python, for comparison purposes
