"the way he is * I can * t take my eyes off him. He really , really wants this. He stops talking and gazes at me . * Still with me ? * he whispers , his voice rich , warm , and seductive. He takes a sip of his wine , his penetrating stare holding mine . The waiter comes to the door , and Christian subtly nods , permitting the waiter to clear our table . * Would you like some more wine ? * * I have to drive. * * Some water then ? * I nod . * Still or sparkling ? * * Sparkling , please. * The waiter leaves . * You * re very quiet , * Christian whispers . * You * re very verbose. * He smiles . * Discipline. There * s a very fine line between pleasure and pain , Anastasia. They are two sides of the same coin , one not existing without the other. I can show you how pleasurable pain can be. You don * t believe me now , but this is what I mean about trust. There will be pain , but nothing that you can * t handle. Again , it comes down to trust. Do you trust me , Ana ? * Ana ! * Yes , I do. * I respond spontaneously , not thinking * because it * s true * I do trust him . * Well , then , * he looks relieved. * The rest of this stuff is just details. * * Important details. * * Okay , let * s talk through those. * My head is swimming with all his words. I should have brought Kate * s digital recorder so I can listen to this again later. There is so much information , so much to process. The waiter re-emerges with our entrees : black cod , asparagus , and crushed potatoes with a hollandaise sauce. I have never felt less like food . * I hope you like fish , * Christian says mildly . I make a stab at my food and take a long drink of my sparkling water. I vehemently wish it was wine . * The rules. Let * s talk about them. The food is a deal breaker ? * * Yes. * * Can I modify to say that you will eat at least three meals a day ? * * No. * I am so not backing down on this. No one is going to dictate to me what I eat. How I fuck , yes , but eat * no , no way . He purses his lips. * I need to know that you * re not hungry. * I frown. Why ? * You * ll have to trust me. * He gazes at me for a moment , and he relaxes . * Touch * , Miss Steele ,"
