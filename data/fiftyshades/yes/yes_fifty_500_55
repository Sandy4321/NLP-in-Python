"laundry. * His gaze is dark. * They were spattered with your vomit. * * Oh. * I flush scarlet. Why oh why does he always catch me off balance ? * I sent Taylor out for another pair and some shoes. They * re in the bag on the chair. * Clean clothes. What an unexpected bonus . * Um * I * ll have a shower , * I mutter. * Thanks. * What else can I say ? I grab the bag and dart into the bathroom away from the unnerving proximity of naked Christian. Michelangelo * s David has nothing on him . In the bathroom , it * s all hot and steamy. I strip off my clothes and quickly clamber into the shower , anxious to be under the cleansing stream of water. It cascades over me , and I hold up my face into the welcoming torrent. I want Christian Grey. I want him badly. Simple fact. For the first time in my life , I want to go to bed with a man. I want to feel his hands and his mouth on me . He said he likes his women sentient. He * s probably not celibate then. But he * s not made a pass at me , unlike Paul or Jos * . I don * t understand. Does he want me ? He wouldn * t kiss me last week. Am I repellent to him ? And yet I * m here and he brought me here. I just don * t know what his game is. What * s he thinking ? You * ve slept in his bed all night , and he * s not touched you , Ana. You do the math. My subconscious has reared her ugly , snide head. I ignore her . The water is warm and soothing. Hmm * I could stay under this shower , in his bathroom , forever. I reach for the body wash and it smells of him. It * s a delicious smell. I rub it all over myself , fantasizing that it * s him * him rubbing this heavenly scented soap into my body , across my breasts , over my stomach , between my thighs with his long-fingered hands. Oh my. My heartbeat picks up again. This feels so * so good . * Breakfast is here. * He knocks on the door , startling me . * O-okay , * I stutter as I * m yanked cruelly out of my erotic daydream . I climb out of the shower and grab two towels. I put my hair in one and wrap it Carmen Miranda style on my head. Hastily , I dry myself , ignoring the pleasurable feel of the towel rubbing against my oversensitized skin . I inspect the bag of jeans. Not only has Taylor brought me jeans and new Converse , but also a pale blue shirt"
