"thirty minutes at most. Thermals aren * t great this time of the morning , but it * s so breathtaking up there at this hour. I hope you * re not nervous. * * Excited. * I beam . Where did this ridiculous grin come from ? Actually , part of me is terrified. My inner goddess * she * s under a blanket behind the sofa . * Good. * He grins back , stroking my face , then disappears from view . I hear and feel his movements as he climbs in behind me. Of course he * s strapped me in so tightly I can * t move around to see him * typical ! We are very low on the ground. In front of me is a panel of dials and levers and a big stick thing. I leave everything alone . Mark Benson appears with a cheerful grin as he checks my straps and leans in and checks the cockpit floor. I think it * s the ballast . * Yep , that * s secure. First time ? * he asks me . * Yes. * * You * ll love it. * * Thanks , Mr. Benson. * * Call me Mark. * He turns to Christian. * Okay ? * * Yep. Let * s go. * I am so glad I haven * t eaten anything. I am beyond excited , and I don * t think my stomach would be game for food , excitement , and leaving the ground. Once again , I am putting myself into this beautiful man * s skilled hands. Mark shuts the cockpit lid , strolls over to the plane in front , and climbs in . The Piper * s single propeller starts , and my nervous stomach relocates itself to my throat. Jeez * I * m really doing this. Mark taxis slowly down the runway , and as the cable takes the strain , we suddenly jolt forward. We * re off. I hear chatter over the radio set behind me. I think it * s Mark talking to the tower * but I can * t make out what he * s saying. As the Piper picks up speed , so do we. It * s very bumpy , and in front of us the single prop plane is still on the ground. Jeez , will we ever get up ? And suddenly , my stomach disappears from my throat and free-falls through my body to the ground * we * re airborne . * Here we go , baby ! * Christian shouts from behind me. And we are in our own bubble , just us two. All I hear is the sound of the wind ripping past and the distant hum of the Piper * s engine . I * m gripping the edge of my seat with both hands , so tightly my knuckles are white."
