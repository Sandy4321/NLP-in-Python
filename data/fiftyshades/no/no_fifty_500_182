"who are now standing beside me turn and gape at me . * He * s sent me out here , * she continues . Oh * * Your speech was great , Kate. * * It was , wasn * t it ? * She beams. * Are you coming ? He can be very insistent. * She rolls her eyes , and I grin . * You have no idea. I can * t leave Ray for long. * I glance up at Ray and hold my fingers up indicating five minutes. He nods , giving me an okay sign , and I follow Kate into the corridor behind the stage. Christian is talking to the chancellor and two of the teaching staff. He looks up when he sees me . * Excuse me , gentlemen , * I hear him murmur. He comes toward me and smiles briefly at Kate . * Thank you , * he says , and before she can reply , he takes my elbow and steers me into what looks like a men * s locker room. He checks to see if it * s empty , and then he locks the door . Holy shit , what does he have in mind ? I blink up at him as he turns on me . * Why haven * t you e-mailed me ? Or texted me back ? * He glares. I * m nonplussed . * I haven * t looked at my computer today , or my phone. * Crap , has he been trying to call ? I try my distraction technique that * s so effective on Kate. * That was a great speech. * * Thank you. * * Explains your food issues to me. * He runs a hand through his hair , exasperated . * Anastasia , I don * t want to go there at the moment. * He closes his eyes , looking pained. * I * ve been worried about you. * * Worried , why ? * * Because you went home in that deathtrap you call a car. * * What ? It * s not a deathtrap. It * s fine. Jos * regularly services it for me. * * Jos * , the photographer ? * Christian * s eyes narrow , his face frosting. Oh , crap . * Yes , the Beetle used to belong to his mother. * * Yes , and probably her mother and her mother before her. It * s not safe. * * I * ve been driving it for over three years. I * m sorry you were worried. Why didn * t you call ? * Jeez , he * s completely overreacting . He takes a deep breath . * Anastasia , I need an answer from you. This waiting around is driving me crazy. * * Christian , I * look , I * ve left"
