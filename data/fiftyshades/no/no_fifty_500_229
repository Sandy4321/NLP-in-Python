"white-toothed smile at Kate , and she almost literally dissolves into the couch . I roll my eyes at the pair of them . * I * d love to stay , baby , but my sister is back from Paris. It * s a compulsory family dinner tonight. * * Can you come by after ? * Kate asks tentatively , all soft and un-Kate-like . I stand and make my way over to the kitchen area on the pretense of unpacking one of the crates. They are going to get icky . * I * ll see if I can escape , * he promises . * I * ll come down with you. * Kate smiles . * Laters , Ana. * Elliot grins . * Bye , Elliot. Say hi to Christian from me. * * Just hi ? * His eyebrows shoot up suggestively . * Yes. * I flush. He winks at me , and I go crimson as he follows Kate out of the apartment . Elliot is adorable and so different from Christian. He * s warm , open , physical , very physical , too physical , with Kate. They can barely keep their hands off each other * to be honest it * s embarrassing * and I am pea green with envy . Kate returns about twenty minutes later with pizza , and we sit , surrounded by crates , in our new open space , eating straight from the box. Kate * s dad has done us proud. The apartment is not large , but it * s big enough , three bedrooms and a large living space that looks out onto Pike Place Market itself. It * s all solid wood floors and red brick , and the kitchen tops are smooth concrete , very utilitarian , very now. We both love that we will be in the heart of the city . At eight , the entry-phone buzzes. Kate leaps up * and my heart leaps into my mouth . * Delivery , Miss Steele , Miss Kavanagh. * Disappointment flows freely and unexpectedly through my veins. It * s not Christian . * Second floor , apartment two. * Kate buzzes the delivery boy in. His mouth falls open when he sees Kate , all tight jeans , T-shirt , and hair piled high with escaping tendrils. She has that effect on men. He holds a bottle of champagne with a helicopter-shaped balloon attached. She gives him a dazzling smile to send him on his way and proceeds to read the card out to me . Ladies , Good luck in your new home . Christian Grey Kate shakes her head in disapproval . * Why can * t he just write * from Christian * ? And what * s with the weird helicopter balloon ? * * Charlie Tango. * * What ? * * Christian flew me to Seattle in his helicopter."
