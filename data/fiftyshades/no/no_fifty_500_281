", * he replies automatically , but there * s an edge to his voice . I * m not saying thank you for fucking me. Although , it was very * * What ? * he asks , and I realize I * m frowning . * What * s wrong ? * I ask softly . * What do you mean ? * * Well * you * re being more weird than usual. * * You find me weird ? * He tries to stifle a smile . * Sometimes. * He regards me for a moment , his eyes speculative. * As ever , I * m surprised by you , Miss Steele. * * Surprised how ? * * Let * s just say that was an unexpected treat. * * We aim to please , Mr. Grey. * I cock my head to one side like he often does to me and give his words back to him . * And please me you do , * he says , but he looks uneasy. * I thought you were going to have a shower. * Oh , he * s dismissing me . * Yes * um , I * ll see you in a moment. * I scurry out of his office completely dumbfounded . He seemed confused. Why ? I have to say as physical experiences go , that was very satisfying. But emotionally * well , I * m rattled by his reaction , and that was about as emotionally enriching as cotton candy is nutritious . Mrs. Jones is still in the kitchen. * Would you like your tea now , Miss Steele ? * * I * ll have a shower first , thank you , * I mutter and take my blazing face quickly out of the room . In the shower , I try to figure out what * s up with Christian. He is the most complicated person I know , and I can not understand his ever-changing moods. He seemed fine when I went into his study. We had sex * and then he wasn * t. No , I don * t get it. I look to my subconscious. She * s whistling with her hands behind her back and looking anywhere but at me. She hasn * t got a clue , and my inner goddess is still basking in a remnant of postcoital glow. No * we * re all clueless . I towel-dry my hair , comb it through with Christian * s one and only hair implement , and put my hair up in a bun. Kate * s plum dress hangs laundered and ironed in the closet along with my clean bra and panties. Mrs. Jones is a marvel. Slipping on Kate * s shoes , I straighten my dress , take a deep breath , and head back out to the great room . Christian is still nowhere"
