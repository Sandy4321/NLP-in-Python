And I have to grin , widely . * You are asking me if you hurt me ? * * The irony is not lost on me , * he smiles sardonically. * Seriously , are you okay ? * His eyes are intense , probing , demanding even . I stretch out beside him , feeling loose-limbed , my bones like jelly , but I * m relaxed , deeply relaxed. I grin at him. I can * t stop grinning. Now I know what all the fuss is about.
