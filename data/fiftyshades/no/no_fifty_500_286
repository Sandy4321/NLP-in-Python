"thought comes involuntarily into my head. My errant mind makes me frown . * Copyediting , perhaps ? Maybe a literary agent , I * m not sure. I am open to opportunities. * He grins. * Very good , Ana. I don * t have any further questions. Do you ? * he directs his question at me . * When would you like someone to start ? * I ask . * As soon as possible , * Elizabeth pipes up. * When could you start ? * * I * m available from next week. * * That * s good to know , * Jack says . * If that * s all everyone has to say * * Elizabeth glances at the two of us * * I think that concludes the interview. * She smiles kindly . * It * s been a pleasure to meet you , Ana , * Jack says softly as he takes my hand. He squeezes it gently , so that I blink up at him as I say good-bye . I feel unsettled as I make my way to my car , though I * m not sure why. I think the interview went well , but it * s so hard to say. Interviews seem such artificial situations ; everyone on their best behavior trying desperately to hide behind a professional fa * ade. Did my face fit ? I shall have to wait and see . I climb into my Audi A3 and head back to the apartment , though I take my time. I * m on the red-eye with a stopover in Atlanta , but my flight doesn * t leave until 10 : 25 this evening , so I have plenty of time . Kate is unpacking boxes in the kitchen when I return . * How did they go ? * she asks , excited. Only Kate can look gorgeous in an oversized shirt , tattered jeans , and a dark blue bandana . * Good , thanks , Kate. Not sure this outfit was cool enough for the second interview. * * Oh ? * * Boho chic might have done it. * Kate raises an eyebrow . * You and boho chic. * She cocks her head to one side * gah ! Why is everyone reminding me of my favorite Fifty Shades ? * Actually , Ana , you * re one of the few people who could really pull that look off. * I grin. * I really liked the second place. I think I could fit in there. The guy who interviewed me was unnerving , though * * I trail off * shit , I * m talking to Megaphone Kavanagh here. Shut up , Ana ! * Oh ? * The Katherine Kavanagh radar for an interesting tidbit of information swoops into action * a tidbit that will only resurface at some inopportune and embarrassing"
