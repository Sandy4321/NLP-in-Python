"to be seen , and Mrs. Jones is checking the contents of the pantry . * Tea now , Miss Steele ? * she asks . * Please. * I smile at her. I feel slightly more confident now that I * m dressed . * Would you like something to eat ? * * No , thank you. * * Of course you * ll have something to eat , * Christian snaps , glowering. * She likes pancakes , bacon , and eggs , Mrs. Jones. * * Yes , Mr. Grey. What would you like , sir ? * * Omelet , please , and some fruit. * He doesn * t take his eyes off me , his expression unfathomable. * Sit , * he orders , pointing to one of the barstools . I oblige , and he sits beside me while Mrs. Jones busies herself with breakfast. Gosh , it * s unnerving having someone else listen to our conversation . * Have you bought your air ticket ? * * No , I * ll buy it when I get home * over the Internet. * He leans on his elbow , rubbing his chin . * Do you have the money ? * Oh no . * Yes , * I say with mock patience as if I * m talking to a small child . He raises a censorious eyebrow at me. Crap . * Yes , I do , thank you , * I amend rapidly . * I have a jet. It * s not scheduled to be used for three days ; it * s at your disposal. * I gape at him. Of course he has a jet , and I have to resist my body * s natural inclination to roll my eyes at him. I want to laugh. But I don * t , as I can * t read his mood . * We * ve already made serious misuse of your company * s aviation fleet. I wouldn * t want to do it again. * * It * s my company , it * s my jet. * He sounds almost wounded. Oh , boys and their toys ! * Thank you for the offer. But I * d be happier taking a scheduled flight. * He looks like he wants to argue further but decides against it . * As you wish. * He sighs. * Do you have much preparation to do for your interview ? * * No. * * Good. You * re still not going to tell me which publishing houses ? * * No. * His lips curl up in a reluctant smile. * I am a man of means , Miss Steele. * * I am fully aware of that , Mr. Grey. Are you going to track my phone ? * I ask innocently . * Actually , I * ll be quite busy"
