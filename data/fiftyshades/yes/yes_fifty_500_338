"I * m out , he grabs me and holds me flush against his body. Suddenly his hand is in my hair , tugging it so my head tips back , and his other hand travels down to the base of my spine. He kisses me , long , hard , and passionately , his tongue in my mouth. His breathing is mounting , his ardor * Holy cow * his erection * we * re in a field. But I don * t care. My hands twist in his hair , anchoring him to me. I want him , here , now , on the ground. He breaks away and gazes down at me , his eyes now dark and luminous in the early morning light , full of raw , arrogant sensuality. Wow. He takes my breath away . * Breakfast , * he whispers , making it sound deliciously erotic . How can he make bacon and eggs sound like forbidden fruit ? It * s an extraordinary skill. He turns , clasping my hand , and we head back toward the car . * What about the glider ? * * Someone will take care of that , * he says dismissively. * We * ll eat now. * His tone is unequivocal . Food ! He * s talking food , when really all I want is him . * Come. * He smiles . I have never seen him like this , and it * s a joy to behold. I find myself walking beside him , hand in hand , with a stupid , goofy grin plastered on my face. It reminds me of when I was ten and spent the day at Disneyland with Ray. It was a perfect day , and this is sure shaping out to be the same . BACK IN THE CAR , as we head back along Interstate 95 toward Savannah , my phone alarm goes off. Oh yes * my pill . * What * s that ? * Christian asks , curious , glancing at me . I fumble in my purse for the packet . * Alarm for my pill , * I mutter as my cheeks flush . His lips quirk up . * Good , well done. I hate condoms. * I flush some more. He * s as patronizing as ever . * I like that you introduced me to Mark as your girlfriend , * I murmur . * Isn * t that what you are ? * He raises an eyebrow . * Am I ? I thought you wanted a submissive. * * So did I , Anastasia , and I do. But I * ve told you , I want more , too. * Oh my. He * s coming around , and hope surges through me , leaving me breathless . * I * m very happy that you want more , * I whisper ."
