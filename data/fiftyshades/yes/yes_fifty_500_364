"frees my other hand , gently pulls the mask from my eyes , and removes the earbuds. I blink in the dim soft light and stare up into his intense gray gaze . * Hi , * he murmurs . * Hi , yourself , * I breathe shyly back at him. His lips quirk up into a smile , and he leans down and kisses me softly . * Well done , you , * he whispers. * Turn over. * Holy fuck * what * s he going to do now ? His eyes soften . * I * m just going to rub your shoulders. * * Oh * okay. * I roll stiffly onto my front. I am so tired. Christian sits astride me and starts to massage my shoulders. I groan loudly * he has such strong , knowing fingers. Leaning down , he kisses my head . * What was that music ? * I mumble almost inarticulately . * It * s called Spem in Alium , a forty-part motet by Thomas Tallis. * * It was * overwhelming. * * I * ve always wanted to fuck to it. * * Not another first , Mr. Grey ? * * Indeed , Miss Steele. * I groan again as his fingers work their magic on my shoulders . * Well , it * s the first time I * ve fucked to it , too , * I murmur sleepily . * Hmm * you and I , we * re giving each other many firsts. * His voice is matter-of-fact . * What did I say to you in my sleep , Chris * er , Sir ? * His hands pause their ministrations for a moment . * You said lots of things , Anastasia. You talked about cages and strawberries * that you wanted more * and that you missed me. * Oh , thank heavens for that . * Is that all ? * The relief in my voice is evident . Christian stops his heavenly massage and shifts so that he * s lying beside me , his head propped up on his elbow. He * s frowning . * What did you think you * d said ? * Oh crap . * That I thought you were ugly , conceited , and that you were hopeless in bed. * The crease on his brow deepens . * Well , naturally I am all those things , and now you * ve got me really intrigued. What are you hiding from me , Miss Steele ? * I blink at him innocently. * I * m not hiding anything. * * Anastasia , you are a hopeless liar. * * I thought you were going to make me giggle after sex ; this isn * t doing it for me. * His lips quirk up. * I can * t tell jokes. * * Mr. Grey"
