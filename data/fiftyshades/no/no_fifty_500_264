"Mia embraces me warmly as we say our good-byes . * We never thought he * d find anyone ! * she gushes . I flush , and Christian rolls his eyes again. I purse my lips. Why can he do that when I can * t ? I want to roll my eyes back at him , but I do not dare , not after his threat in the boathouse . * Take care of yourself , Ana dear , * Grace says kindly . Christian , embarrassed or frustrated by the lavish attention I * m receiving from the remaining Greys , grabs my hand and pulls me to his side . * Let * s not frighten her away or spoil her with too much affection , * he grumbles . * Christian , stop teasing , * Grace scolds him indulgently , her eyes glowing with love and affection for him . Somehow , I don * t think he * s teasing. I surreptitiously watch their interaction. It * s obvious Grace adores him with a mother * s unconditional love. He bends and kisses her stiffly . * Mom , * he says , and there * s an undercurrent in his voice * reverence maybe ? * Mr. Grey * good-bye and thank you. * I hold out my hand to him , and he hugs me , too ! * Please , call me Carrick. I do hope we see you again very soon , Ana. * Our farewells said , Christian leads me to the car , where Taylor is waiting. Has he been waiting here the whole time ? Taylor opens my door , and I slide into the back of the Audi . I feel some of the tension leaving my shoulders. Jeez , what a day. I am exhausted , physically and emotionally. After a brief conversation with Taylor , Christian clambers into the car beside me. He turns to face me . * Well , it seems my family likes you , too , * he murmurs . Too ? The depressing thought about how I came to be invited pops unbidden and very unwelcome into my head. Taylor starts the car and heads away from the circle of light in the driveway to the darkness of the road. I gaze at Christian , and he * s staring at me . * What ? * he asks , his voice quiet . I flounder momentarily. No * I * ll tell him. He * s always complaining that I don * t talk to him . * I think that you felt trapped into bringing me to meet your parents. * My voice is soft and hesitant. * If Elliot hadn * t asked Kate , you * d never have asked me. * I can * t see his face in the dark , but he tilts his head , gaping at me . *"
