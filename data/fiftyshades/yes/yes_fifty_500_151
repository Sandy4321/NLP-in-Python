"endless choice , * he breathes against my lips. He withdraws his hand and reaches over to the bedside table for a foil packet. He kneels up between my legs , and very slowly he pulls my panties off , staring down at me , his eyes gleaming. He puts on the condom. I watch fascinated , mesmerized . * How nice is this ? * he says as he strokes himself . * I meant it as a joke , * I whimper. Please fuck me , Christian . He raises his eyebrows as his hand moves up and down his impressive length . * A joke ? * His voice is menacingly soft . * Yes. Please , Christian , * I beseech him . * Are you laughing now ? * * No , * I mewl . I * m a ball of sexual tense need. He stares down at me for a moment , measuring my need , then he grabs me suddenly and flips me over. It takes me by surprise , and because my hands are tied , I have to support myself on my elbows. He pushes both my knees up the bed so my behind is in the air , and he slaps me hard. Before I can react , he plunges inside me. I cry out * from the slap and from his sudden assault , and I come instantly again and again , falling apart beneath him as he continues to slam deliciously into me. He doesn * t stop. I * m spent. I can * t take this * and he pounds on and on and on * then I * m building again * surely not * no * * Come on , Anastasia , again , * he growls through clenched teeth , and unbelievably , my body responds , convulsing around him as I climax anew , calling out his name. I shatter again into tiny fragments , and Christian stills , finally letting go , silently finding his release. He collapses on top of me , breathing hard . * How nice was that ? * he asks through his gritted teeth . Oh my . I lie panting and spent on the bed , eyes closed as he slowly pulls out of me. He rises immediately and dresses. When he * s fully clothed , he climbs back on the bed and gently undoes my binding and pulls my T-shirt off. I flex my fingers and rub my wrists , smiling at the woven pattern imprinted on my wrists from the tie. I readjust my bra as he pulls the duvet and quilt over me. I stare up at him completely dazed , and he smirks down at me . * That was really nice , * I whisper , smiling coyly . * There * s that word again. * * You don * t like that word ? * *"
