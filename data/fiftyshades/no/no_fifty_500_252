"as Taylor whisks us into the night toward Bellevue . IT IS JUST BEFORE eight when the Audi turns into the driveway of a colonial-style mansion. It * s breathtaking , even down to the roses around the door. Picture-book perfect . * Are you ready for this ? * Christian asks as Taylor pulls up outside the impressive front door . I nod , and he gives my hand another reassuring squeeze . * First for me , too , * he whispers , then smiles wickedly. * Bet you wish you were wearing your underwear right now , * he teases . I flush. I * d forgotten my missing panties. Fortunately , Taylor has climbed out of the car and is opening my door so he can * t hear our exchange. I scowl at Christian , who grins broadly as I turn and climb out of the car . Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey is on the doorstep waiting for us. She looks elegantly sophisticated in a pale blue silk dress. Behind her stands Mr. Grey , I presume , tall , blond , and as handsome in his own way as Christian . * Anastasia , you * ve met my mother , Grace. This is my dad , Carrick. * * Mr. Grey , what a pleasure to meet you. * I smile and shake his outstretched hand . * The pleasure is all mine , Anastasia. * * Please , call me Ana. * His blue eyes are soft and gentle . * Ana , how lovely to see you again. * Grace wraps me in a warm hug. * Come in , my dear. * * Is she here ? * I hear a screech from within the house. I glance nervously at Christian . * That would be Mia , my little sister , * he says almost irritably , but not quite . There * s an undercurrent of affection in his words , the way his voice grows softer and his eyes crinkle as he mentions her name. Christian obviously adores her. It * s a revelation. And she comes barreling down the hall , raven haired , tall , and curvaceous. She * s about my age . * Anastasia ! I * ve heard so much about you. * She hugs me hard . Holy cow. I can * t help but smile at her boundless enthusiasm . * Ana , please , * I murmur as she drags me into the large vestibule. It * s all dark wood floors and antique rugs with a sweeping staircase to the second floor . * He * s never brought a girl home before , * says Mia , dark eyes bright with excitement . I glimpse Christian rolling his eyes , and I raise an eyebrow at him. He narrows his eyes at me . * Mia , calm down , * Grace admonishes softly. * Hello , darling"
