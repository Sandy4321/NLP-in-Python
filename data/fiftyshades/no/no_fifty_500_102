"on so you can continue your * er * dancing ? * I stare down at my fingers , knowing that I am turning puce . * Please , don * t stop on my account. It * s very entertaining. * His tone is one of wry amusement . I purse my lips. Entertaining , eh ? My subconscious has doubled over in laughter at me. I turn and continue to whisk the eggs , probably beating them a little harder than necessary. In a moment , he * s beside me. He gently pulls my pigtail . * I love these , * he whispers. * They won * t protect you. * Hmm , Bluebeard * * How would you like your eggs ? * I ask tartly. He smiles . * Thoroughly whisked and beaten. * He smirks . I turn back to the task at hand , trying to hide my smile. He * s hard to stay mad at. Especially when he * s being so uncharacteristically playful. He opens a drawer and takes out two slate black placemats for the breakfast bar. I pour the egg mix into a pan , pull out the bacon , turn it over , and put it back under the grill . When I turn back around , there is orange juice on the table , and he * s making coffee . * Would you like some tea ? * * Yes , please. If you have some. * I find a couple of plates and place them in the warming tray of the range. Christian reaches into a cupboard and pulls out some Twinings English Breakfast tea. I purse my lips . * Bit of a foregone conclusion , wasn * t I ? * * Are you ? I * m not sure we * ve concluded anything yet , Miss Steele , * he murmurs . What does he mean by that ? Our negotiations ? Our , er * relationship * whatever that is ? He * s still so cryptic. I serve up the breakfast onto the heated plates and lay them on the placemats. I hunt in the refrigerator and find some maple syrup . I glance up at Christian , and he * s waiting for me to sit down . * Miss Steele. * He motions to one of the barstools . * Mr. Grey. * I nod in acknowledgment. I climb up and wince slightly as I sit down . * Just how sore are you ? * he asks as he sits down. I flush. Why does he ask such personal questions ? * Well , to be truthful , I have nothing to compare this to , * I snap at him. * Did you wish to offer your commiserations ? * I ask too sweetly. I think he * s trying to stifle a smile , but I can * t be sure ."
