"! Something you can * t do ? * I grin at him , and he grins back . * No , hopeless joke teller. * He looks so proud of himself that I start to giggle . * I * m a hopeless joke teller , too. * * That is such a lovely sound , * he murmurs , and he leans forward and kisses me . * And you are hiding something , Anastasia. I may have to torture it out of you. * CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX I wake with a jolt. I think I * ve just fallen down some stairs in a dream , and I bolt upright , momentarily disoriented. It is dark , and I * m in Christian * s bed alone. Something has woken me , some nagging thought. I glance over at the alarm clock on his bedside. It is five in the morning , but I feel rested. Why is that ? Oh * it * s the time difference * it would be eight a.m. in Georgia. Holy crap * I need to take my pill. I clamber out of bed , grateful for whatever it is that has woken me. I can hear faint notes from the piano. Christian is playing. This I must see. I love watching him play. Naked , I grab my bathrobe from the chair and wander quietly down the corridor , slipping on my robe and listening to the magical sound of the melodic lament that * s coming from the great room . Shrouded in darkness , Christian sits in a bubble of light as he plays , and his hair glints with burnished copper highlights. He looks naked , though I know he * s wearing his PJ bottoms. He * s concentrating , playing beautifully , lost in the melancholy of the music. I hesitate , watching from the shadows , not wanting to interrupt him. I want to hold him. He looks lost , sad even , and achingly lonely * or maybe it * s just the music that * s so full of poignant sorrow. He finishes the piece , pauses for a split second , then starts to play it again. I move cautiously toward him , drawn as the moth to the flame * the idea makes me smile. He glances up at me and frowns before his gaze returns to his hands . Oh , crap , is he pissed off that I am disturbing him ? * You should be asleep , * he scolds mildly . I can tell he * s preoccupied with something . * So should you , * I retort not quite as mildly . He glances up again , his lips twitching with a trace of a smile . * Are you scolding me , Miss Steele ? * * Yes , Mr. Grey , I am. * * Well , I can * t sleep. *"
