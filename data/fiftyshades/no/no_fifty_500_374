"* no * * And I find myself struggling out of his grasp , pushing him away. Fighting him . * Don * t touch me ! * I hiss. I straighten and stare at him , and he * s watching me as if I might bolt , eyes wide , bemused. I dash the tears angrily out of my eyes with the backs of my hands , glaring at him . * This is what you really like ? Me , like this ? * I use the sleeve of the bathrobe to wipe my nose . He gazes at me warily . * Well , you are one fucked-up son of a bitch. * * Ana , * he pleads , shocked . * Don * t you dare * Ana * me ! You need to sort your shit out , Grey ! * And with that , I turn stiffly , and I walk out of the playroom , closing the door quietly behind me . I clasp the door handle behind me and briefly lean back against the door. Where to go ? Do I run ? Do I stay ? I am so mad , scalding tears spill down my cheeks , and I brush them furiously aside.

What was I thinking ? Why did I let him do that to me ? I wanted the dark , to explore how bad it could be * but it * s too dark for me. I can not do this. Yet , this is what he does ; this is how he gets his kicks . What a monumental wake-up call. And to be fair to him , he warned me and warned me , time and again. He * s not normal. He has needs that I can not fulfill. I realize that now. I don * t want him to hit me like that again , ever. I think of the couple of times he has hit me , and how easy he was on me by"
