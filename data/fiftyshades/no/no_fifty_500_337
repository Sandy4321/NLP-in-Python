"air , listening to the wind and the silence , in the early morning light. Who could ask for more ? * See the joystick in front of you ? * he shouts again . I look at the stick that is jerking between my legs. Oh no , where * s he going with this ? * Grab hold. * Oh , shit. He * s going to make me fly the plane. No ! * Go on , Anastasia. Grab it , * he urges more vehemently . Tentatively , I grasp it and feel the pitch and yaw of what I assume are rudders and paddles or whatever keeps this thing in the air . * Hold tight * keep it steady. See the middle dial in front ?

He leans down to unbuckle me . * That was extraordinary. Thank you , * I whisper . * Was it more ? * he asks , his voice tinged with hope . * Much more , * I breathe , and he grins . * Come. * He holds out his hand for me , and I clamber out of the cockpit .
