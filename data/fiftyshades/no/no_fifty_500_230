"* I shrug . Kate stares at me openmouthed. I have to say I love these occasions * Katherine Kavanagh , silent and floored * they are so rare. I take a brief and luxurious moment to enjoy it . * Yep , he has a helicopter , which he flew himself , * I state proudly . * Of course the obscenely rich bastard has a helicopter. Why didn * t you tell me ? * Kate looks accusingly at me , but she * s smiling , shaking her head in disbelief . * I * ve had a lot on my mind lately. * She frowns . * Are you going to be okay while I * m away ? * * Of course , * I answer reassuringly. New city , no job * nut-job boyfriend . * Did you give him our address ? * No , but stalking is one of his specialties , * I muse matter-of-factly . Kate * s brow knits further . * Somehow I * m not surprised. He worries me , Ana. At least it * s a good champagne and it * s chilled. * Of course. Only Christian would send chilled champagne , or get his secretary to do it * or maybe Taylor. We open it there and then and find our teacups * they were the last items to be packed . * Bollinger Grande Ann * e Ros * 1999 , an excellent vintage. * I grin at Kate , and we clink teacups . I WAKE EARLY TO a gray Sunday morning after a surprisingly refreshing night * s sleep and lie awake staring at my crates. You should really be unpacking these , my subconscious nags , pursing her harpy lips together. No * today * s the day. My inner goddess is beside herself , hopping from foot to foot. Anticipation hangs heavy and portentous over my head like a dark tropical storm cloud. Butterflies flood my belly * as well as a darker , carnal , captivating ache as I try to imagine what he will do to me * and of course , I have to sign that damned contract , or do I ? I hear the ping of incoming mail from the mean machine on the floor beside my bed .
