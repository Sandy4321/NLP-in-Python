"time ago. * * How did you hurt her ? * * I suspended her from my playroom ceiling. In fact , that * s one of your questions. Suspension * that * s what the carabiners are for in the playroom. Rope play. One of the ropes was tied too tightly. * I hold my hand up , begging him to stop . * I don * t need to know any more. So you won * t suspend me then ? * * Not if you really don * t want to. You can make that a hard limit. * * Okay. * * So obeying , do you think you can manage that ? * He stares at me , his gaze intense. The seconds tick by . * I could try , * I whisper . * Good. * He smiles. * Now term. One month instead of three is no time at all , especially if you want a weekend away from me each month. I don * t think I * ll be able to stay away from you for that length of time. I can barely manage it now. * He pauses . He can * t stay away from me ? What ? * How about one day over one weekend per month you get to yourself * but I get a midweek night that week ? * * Okay. * * And please , let * s try it for three months. If it * s not for you , then you can walk away anytime. * * Three months ? * I * m feeling railroaded. I take another large sip of wine and treat myself to another oyster. I could learn to like these . * The ownership thing , that * s just terminology and goes back to the principle of obeying. It * s to get you into the right frame of mind , to understand where I * m coming from. And I want you to know that as soon as you cross my threshold as my submissive , I will do what I like to you. You have to accept that and willingly. That * s why you have to trust me. I will fuck you , any time , any way I want * anywhere I want. I will discipline you , because you will screw up. I will train you to please me . * But I know you * ve not done this before. Initially , we * ll take it slowly , and I will help you. We * ll build up to various scenarios. I want you to trust me , but I know I have to earn your trust , and I will. The * or otherwise * * again it * s to help you get into the mindset ; it means anything goes. * He * s so passionate , mesmerizing. This is obviously his obsession ,"
