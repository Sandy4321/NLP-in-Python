"look is triumphant mixed with relief . * That * s better , * he murmurs , and smiles a wicked , knowing smile. He bends and starts undoing one of my sneakers. Oh no * no * my feet. No. I * ve just been running . * No , * I protest , trying to kick him off . He stops . * If you struggle , I * ll tie your feet , too. If you make a noise , Anastasia , I will gag you. Keep quiet.
