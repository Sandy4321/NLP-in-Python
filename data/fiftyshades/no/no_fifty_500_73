"* We * ll be there in a few minutes , * Christian mutters , and suddenly my blood is pounding in my ears as my heartbeat accelerates and adrenaline spikes through my system. He starts talking to air traffic control again , but I am no longer listening. I think I * m going to faint. My fate is in his hands .
