"was the most embarrassing question. I was mortified , and he was pissed to be asked , too. * I scowl at the memory . * Whenever he * s in the society pages , he never has a date. * * It was embarrassing. The whole thing was embarrassing. I * m glad I * ll never have to lay eyes on him again. * * Oh , Ana , it can * t have been that bad. I think he sounds quite taken with you. * Taken with me ? Now Kate * s being ridiculous . * Would you like a sandwich ? * * Please. * WE TALK NO MORE of Christian Grey that evening , much to my relief. Once we * ve eaten , I * m able to sit at the dining table with Kate and , while she works on her article , I work on my essay on Tess of the d * Urbervilles. Damn , that woman was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong century. By the time I finish , it * s midnight , and Kate has long since gone to bed. I make my way to my room , exhausted , but pleased that I * ve accomplished so much for a Monday . I curl up in my white iron bed , wrap my mother * s quilt around me , close my eyes , and I * m instantly asleep. That night I dream of dark places , bleak , cold white floors , and gray eyes . FOR THE REST OF the week , I throw myself into my studies and my job at Clayton * s. Kate is busy , too , compiling her last edition of the student newspaper before she has to relinquish it to the new editor while also cramming for her finals. By Wednesday , she * s much better , and I no longer have to endure the sight of her pink-flannel-with-too-many-rabbits PJs. I call my mom in Georgia to check on her , but also so she can wish me luck on my final exams. She proceeds to tell me about her latest venture into candlemaking * my mother is all about new business ventures. Fundamentally , she * s bored and wants something to occupy her time , but she has the attention span of a goldfish. It * ll be something new next week. She worries me. I hope she hasn * t mortgaged the house to finance this latest scheme. And I hope Bob * her relatively new but much older husband * is keeping an eye on her now that I * m no longer there. He does seem a lot more grounded than Husband Number Three . * How are things with you , Ana ? * For a moment , I hesitate , and I have Mom * s full attention. * I * m fine."
