". * She died when I was four. I don * t really remember her. Carrick has given me some details. I only remember certain things. Please go to sleep. * * Good night , Christian. * * Good night , Ana. * And I slip into a dazed and exhausted sleep , dreaming of a four-year-old gray-eyed boy in a dark , scary , miserable place . CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE There is light everywhere. Bright , warm , piercing light , and I endeavor to keep it at bay for a few more precious minutes. I want to hide , just a few more minutes.
