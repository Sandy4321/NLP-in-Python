"in Montesano is getting along. How was the drive down ? * RAY PULLS HIS CAR into the campus parking lot , and we follow the stream of humanity dotted with ubiquitous black and red gowns heading toward the gym . * Good luck , Annie. You seem awfully nervous. Do you have to do anything ? * Holy crap * why has Ray picked today to be observant ? * No , Dad. It * s a big day. * And I * m going to see him . * Yeah , my baby girl has gotten a degree. I * m proud of you , Annie. * * Aw * thanks , Dad. * Oh , I love this man . The gym is crowded. Ray has gone to sit with the other parents and well-wishers in the tiered seating , while I make my way to my seat. I * m wearing my black gown and my cap , and I feel protected by them , anonymous. There is no one on the stage yet , but I can * t seem to steady my nerves. My heart is pounding , and my breathing is shallow. He * s here , somewhere. I wonder if Kate is talking to him , interrogating him maybe. I make my way to my seat amongst fellow students whose surnames also begin with S. I am in the second row , affording me yet more anonymity. I glance behind me and spot Ray high up in the bleachers. I give him a wave. He self-consciously gives me a half-wave , half-salute back. I sit and wait . The auditorium fills quickly , and the buzz of excited voices gets louder and louder. The row of seats in front fills. On either side of me , I am joined by two girls whom I don * t know from a different department. They * re obviously close friends and talk across me excitedly . At eleven precisely , the chancellor appears from behind the stage , followed by the three vice chancellors and then the senior professors , all decked out in their black and red regalia. We stand and applaud our teaching staff. Some professors nod and wave , others look bored. Professor Collins , my tutor and my favorite teacher , looks like he * s just fallen out of bed , as usual. Last on to the stage are Kate and Christian. Christian stands out in his bespoke gray suit , copper highlights glinting in his hair under the auditorium lights. He looks so serious and self-contained. As he sits , he undoes his single-breasted jacket , and I glimpse his tie. Holy shit * that tie ! I rub my wrists reflexively. I can not take my eyes off him. He * s wearing that tie , on purpose no doubt. My mouth presses into a hard line. The audience sits down and the applause ceases . *"
