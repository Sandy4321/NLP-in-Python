"wish has come true : I can stand and admire Grey from not so afar. Twice our eyes lock , and I have to tear myself away from his cloudy gaze . * Enough sitting. * Katherine wades in again. * Standing , Mr. Grey ? * she asks . He stands , and Travis scurries in to remove the chair. The shutter on Jos * * s Nikon starts clicking again . * I think we have enough , * Jos * announces five minutes later . * Great , * says Kate. * Thank you again , Mr. Grey. * She shakes his hand , as does Jos * . * I look forward to reading the article , Miss Kavanagh , * murmurs Grey , and turns to me , standing by the door. * Will you walk with me , Miss Steele ? * he asks . * Sure , * I say , completely thrown. I glance anxiously at Kate , who shrugs at me. I notice Jos * scowling behind her . * Good day to you all , * says Grey as he opens the door , standing aside to allow me out first . Holy hell * what * s this about ? What does he want ? I pause in the hotel corridor , fidgeting nervously as Grey emerges from the room followed by Mr. Buzz Cut in his sharp suit . * I * ll call you , Taylor , * he murmurs to Buzz Cut. Taylor wanders back down the corridor , and Grey turns his burning gray gaze to me. Crap * have I done something wrong ? * I wondered if you would join me for coffee this morning. * My heart slams into my mouth. A date ? Christian Grey is asking me on a date. He * s asking if you want a coffee. Maybe he thinks you haven * t woken up yet , my subconscious whines at me in a sneering mood again. I clear my throat , trying to control my nerves . * I have to drive everyone home , * I murmur apologetically , twisting my hands and fingers in front of me . * Taylor , * he calls , making me jump. Taylor , who had been retreating down the corridor , turns and heads back toward us . * Are they based at the university ? * Grey asks , his voice soft and inquiring. I nod , too stunned to speak . * Taylor can take them. He * s my driver. We have a large 4x4 here , so he * ll be able to take the equipment , too. * * Mr. Grey ? * Taylor asks when he reaches us , giving nothing away . * Please , can you drive the photographer , his assistant , and Miss Kavanagh back home ? * * Certainly , sir , * Taylor replies ."
