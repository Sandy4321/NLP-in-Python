"to remember what Kate had written in her article. Adopted at age four , I think. I can * t imagine that Grace starved him , so it must have been before then , as a little boy. I swallow , my heart constricting at the thought of a hungry , gray-eyed toddler. Oh no. What kind of life did he have before the Greys got hold of him and rescued him ?
