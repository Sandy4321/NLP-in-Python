"how rich you are , you don * t drop everything and get in your private plane to cross a whole continent just for afternoon tea. Go to him ! This is a beautiful location , very romantic. It * s also neutral territory. * I squirm under her gaze. I want to go and I don * t . * Darling , don * t feel you have to come back with me. I want you happy * and right now I think the key to your happiness is upstairs in room 612. If you need to come home later , the key is under the yucca plant on the front porch. If you stay * well * you * re a big girl now. Just be safe. * I flush Stars and Stripes red. Jeez , Mom . * Let * s finish our Cosmos first. * * That * s my girl , Ana. * She grins . I KNOCK TIMIDLY ON room 612 and wait. Christian opens the door. He * s on his cell. He blinks at me in complete surprise , then holds the door open wide and beckons me into his room . * All the redundancy packages concluded ? * And the cost ? * * Christian whistles between his teeth. * Sheesh * that was one expensive mistake * And Lucas ? * * I glance around the room. He * s in a suite , like the one at the Heathman. The furnishings here are ultramodern , very now. All muted dark purples and golds with bronze starbursts on the walls. Christian walks over to a dark wood unit and pulls open a door to reveal a minibar. He indicates that I should help myself , then wanders into the bedroom. I assume it * s so I can no longer hear his conversation. I shrug. He didn * t stop his call when I entered his study that time. I hear water running * he * s filling a bath. I help myself to an orange juice. He ambles back into the room . * Have Andrea send me the schematics. Barney said he * d cracked the problem * * Christian laughs. * No , Friday * There * s a plot of land here that I * m interested in * Yeah , get Bill to call * No , tomorrow * I want to see what Georgia will offer if we move in. * Christian doesn * t take his eyes off me. Handing me a glass , he points to an ice bucket . * If their incentives are attractive enough * I think we should consider it , though I * m not sure about the damned heat here * I agree , Detroit has its advantages , too , and it * s cooler * * His face darkens momentarily. Why ? * Get Bill to call. Tomorrow * Not too early. *"
