"Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : Fine Morning Date : May 30 2011 19 : 05 To : Christian Grey Dear Sir , The morning was exemplary for me , too , in spite of you weirding out on me after the impeccable desk sex. Don * t think I didn * t notice . Thank you for breakfast. Or thank Mrs. Jones . I * d like to ask you questions about her * without you weirding out on me again . Ana My finger hovers over the * send * button , and I am reassured that I * ll be on the other side of the continent this time tomorrow . From : Christian Grey Subject : Publishing and You ? Date : May 30 2011 19 : 10 To : Anastasia Steele Anastasia , * Weirding * is not a verb and should not be used by anyone who wants to go into publishing. Impeccable ? Compared to what , pray tell ? And what do you need to ask about Mrs. Jones ? I * m intrigued . Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : You and Mrs. Jones Date : May 30 2011 19 : 17 To : Christian Grey Dear Sir , Language evolves and moves on. It is an organic thing. It is not stuck in an ivory tower , hung with expensive works of art and overlooking most of Seattle with a helipad stuck on its roof . Impeccable * compared to the other times we have * what * s your word * oh yes * fucked. Actually the fucking has been pretty impeccable , period , in my humble opinion * but then , as you know , I have very limited experience . Is Mrs. Jones an ex-sub of yours ? Ana My finger hovers once more over the * send * button , and I press it . From : Christian Grey Subject : Language. Watch Your Mouth ! Date : May 30 2011 19 : 22 To : Anastasia Steele Anastasia , Mrs. Jones is a valued employee. I have never had any relationship with her beyond our professional one. I do not employ anyone I * ve had any sexual relations with. I am shocked that you would think so. The only person I would make an exception to this rule is you * because you are a bright young woman with remarkable negotiating skills. Though , if you continue to use such language , I may have to reconsider taking you on here. I am glad you have limited experience. Your experience will continue to be limited * just to me. I shall take impeccable as a compliment * though with you , I * m never sure if that * s what you mean or if your sense of irony is getting the better"
