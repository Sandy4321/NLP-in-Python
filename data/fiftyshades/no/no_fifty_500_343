"Date : June 2 2011 10 : 32 EST To : Christian Grey You are a cad and a scoundrel * definitely no gentleman . So , what did I say ? No kisses for you until you talk ! From : Christian Grey Subject : Sleeping Talking Beauty Date : June 2 2011 10 : 35 EST To : Anastasia Steele It would be most ungallant of me to say , and I have already been chastised for that . But if you behave yourself , I may tell you this evening. I do have to go into a meeting now . Laters , baby . Christian Grey CEO , Cad & Scoundrel , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . Right ! I shall maintain radio silence until this evening. I fume. Jeez. Suppose I * ve said I hate him , or worse still , that I love him , in my sleep. Oh , I hope not. I am not ready to tell him that , and I * m sure he * s not ready to hear it , if he ever wants to hear it. I scowl at my computer and decide that whatever Mom cooks , I will make bread to vent my frustrations while kneading the dough . MY MOM HAS DECIDED on gazpacho soup and a barbecue with steaks marinated in olive oil , garlic , and lemon. Christian likes meat , and it * s simple to do. Bob has volunteered to man the BBQ grill. What is it about men and fire ? I ponder as I trail after my mother through the supermarket with the shopping cart . As we browse the raw meat cabinet , my phone rings. I scramble for it , thinking it may be Christian. I don * t recognize the number . * Hello ? * I answer breathlessly . * Anastasia Steele ? * * Yes. * * It * s Elizabeth Morgan from SIP. * * Oh * hi. * * I * m calling to offer you the job of assistant to Mr. Jack Hyde. We * d like you to start on Monday. * * Wow. That * s great. Thank you ! * * You know the salary details ? * * Yes. Yes * that * s * I mean , I accept your offer. I * d love to come and work for you. * * Excellent. We * ll see you Monday at 8 : 30 a.m. ? * * See you then. Good-bye. And thank you. * I beam at my mom . * You have a job ? * I nod gleefully , and she squeals and hugs me in the middle of Publix supermarket . * Congratulations , darling ! We have to buy some champagne ! * She * s clapping her hands and jumping up and down. Is she forty-two or twelve ? I glance down at my phone and frown"
