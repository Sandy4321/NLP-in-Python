"the end of my academic career. I shall never have to sit in rows of anxious , isolated students again. Inside I * m doing graceful cartwheels around my head , knowing full well that * s the only place I can do graceful cartwheels. Kate stops writing and puts her pen down. She glances across at me , and I catch her Cheshire cat smile , too . We head back to our apartment together in her Mercedes , refusing to discuss our final paper.
