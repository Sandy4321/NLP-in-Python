"he * s said my name. My heartbeat has accelerated , and my cheeks are heating up again. Nervously , I tuck my loosened hair behind my ear . He cocks his head to one side . * These aren * t your own questions ? * The blood drains from my head . * Er * no. Kate * Miss Kavanagh * she compiled the questions. * * Are you colleagues on the student paper ? * Oh no. I have nothing to do with the student paper. It * s her extracurricular activity , not mine. My face is aflame . * No. She * s my roommate. * He rubs his chin in quiet deliberation , his gray eyes appraising me . * Did you volunteer to do this interview ? * he asks , his voice deadly quiet . Hang on , who * s supposed to be interviewing whom ? His eyes burn into me , and I * m compelled to answer with the truth . * I was drafted. She * s not well. * My voice is weak and apologetic . * That explains a great deal. * There * s a knock at the door , and Blonde Number Two enters . * Mr. Grey , forgive me for interrupting , but your next meeting is in two minutes. * * We * re not finished here , Andrea. Please cancel my next meeting. * Andrea hesitates , gaping at him. She appears lost. He turns his head slowly to face her and raises his eyebrows. She flushes bright pink. Oh , good. It * s not just me . * Very well , Mr. Grey , * she mutters , then exits. He frowns , and turns his attention back to me . * Where were we , Miss Steele ? * Oh , we * re back to * Miss Steele * now . * Please , don * t let me keep you from anything. * * I want to know about you. I think that * s only fair. * His eyes are alight with curiosity. Double crap. Where * s he going with this ? He places his elbows on the arms of the chair and steeples his fingers in front of his mouth. His mouth is very * distracting. I swallow . * There * s not much to know. * * What are your plans after you graduate ? * I shrug , thrown by his interest. Move to Seattle with Kate , find a job. I haven * t really thought beyond my finals . * I haven * t made any plans , Mr. Grey. I just need to get through my final exams. * Which I should be studying for right now , rather than sitting in your palatial , swanky , sterile office , feeling uncomfortable under your penetrating gaze . * We run an excellent internship program here ,"
