"doesn * t affect me quite as much as that , but it gives you an idea , * I murmur , staring anxiously at him . * Oh , * he says . Crap. He looks completely and utterly lost , like I * ve pulled the rug from under his feet . Taking a deep breath , I move around the table until I am standing in front of him , gazing into his apprehensive eyes . * You hate it that much ? * he breathes , his eyes filled with horror . * Well * no , * I reassure him. Jeez * that * s how he feels about people touching him ? * No. I feel ambivalent about it. I don * t like it , but I don * t hate it. * * But last night , in the playroom , you * * * I do it for you , Christian , because you need it. I don * t. You didn * t hurt me last night. That was in a different context , and I can rationalize that internally , and I trust you. But when you want to punish me , I worry that you * ll hurt me. * His eyes darken like a turbulent storm. Time moves and expands and slips away before he answers softly . * I want to hurt you. But not beyond anything that you couldn * t take. * Fuck ! * Why ? * He runs his hand through his hair , and he shrugs . * I just need it. * He pauses , gazing at me with anguish , and he closes his eyes and shakes his head. * I can * t tell you , * he whispers . * Can * t or won * t ? * * Won * t. * * So you know why. * * Yes. * * But you won * t tell me. * * If I do , you will run screaming from this room , and you * ll never want to return. * He stares at me warily. * I can * t risk that , Anastasia. * * You want me to stay. * * More than you know. I couldn * t bear to lose you. * Oh my . He gazes down at me , and suddenly , he pulls me into his arms and he * s kissing me , kissing me passionately. It takes me completely by surprise , and I sense his panic and desperate need in his kiss . * Don * t leave me. You said you wouldn * t leave me , and you begged me not to leave you , in your sleep , * he murmurs against my lips . Oh * my nocturnal confessions . * I don * t want to go. * And my heart clenches , turning itself inside out ."
