"my way around the kitchen . Being busy is good. It allows a bit of time to think but not too deeply. Music blaring in my ears also helps to stave off deep thought. I came here to spend the night in Christian Grey * s bed and managed it , even though he doesn * t let anyone in his bed. I smile , mission accomplished. Big time. I grin. Big , big time , and I * m distracted by the memory of last night. His words , his body , his lovemaking * I close my eyes as my body hums at the recollection , and my muscles contract deliciously deep in my belly. My subconscious scowls at me * Fucking * not lovemaking , she screams at me like a harpy. I ignore her , but deep down I know she has a point. I shake my head to concentrate on the task at hand . There is a state-of-the-art range. I think I have the hang of it. I need somewhere to keep the pancakes warm , and I start on the bacon. Amy Studt is singing in my ear about misfits. This song used to mean so much to me ; that * s because I * m a misfit. I have never fitted in anywhere and now * I have an indecent proposal to consider from King Misfit himself. Why is he this way ? Nature or nurture ? It * s so alien to anything I know . I put the bacon under the grill , and while it * s cooking , I whisk some eggs. I turn , and Christian is sitting on one of the barstools at the breakfast bar , leaning on it , his face supported by his steepled hands. He * s still wearing the T-shirt he slept in. Just-fucked hair really , really suits him , as does his designer stubble. He looks both amused and bewildered. I freeze , flush , then gather myself and pull the headphones out of my ears , my knees weak at the sight of him . * Good morning , Miss Steele. You * re very energetic this morning , * he says dryly . * I-I slept well , * I stutter my explanation. His lips try to mask his smile . * I can * t imagine why. * He pauses and frowns. * So did I after I came back to bed. * * Are you hungry ? * * Very , * he says with an intense look , and I don * t think he * s referring to food . * Pancakes , bacon , and eggs ? * * Sounds great. * * I don * t know where you keep your placemats. * I shrug , trying desperately hard not to look flustered . * I * ll do that. You cook. Would you like me to put some music"
