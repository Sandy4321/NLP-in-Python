"I don * t believe I deserve it , Mr. Grey , especially after tolerating your unprovoked attack. * * Unprovoked ? You kissed me. * He tries his best to look wounded . I purse my lips. * It was attack as the best form of defense. * * Defense against what ? * * You and your twitchy palm. * He cocks his head to one side and smiles at me as Mia comes clattering up the stairs. * But it was tolerable ? * he asks softly . I flush. * Barely , * I whisper , but I can * t help my smirk . * Oh , there you are. * She beams at us . * I was showing Anastasia around. * Christian holds his hand out to me , his gray eyes intense . I put my hand into his , and he gives it a soft squeeze . * Kate and Elliot are about to leave. Can you believe those two ? They can * t keep their hands off each other. * Mia feigns disgust and looks from Christian to me. * What have you been doing in here ? * Jeez , she * s forward. I blush scarlet . * Showing Anastasia my rowing trophies , * Christian says without missing a beat , completely poker-faced. * Let * s go say good-bye to Kate and Elliot. * Rowing trophies ? He pulls me gently in front of him , and as Mia turns to go , he swats my behind. I gasp in surprise . * I will do it again , Anastasia , and soon , * he threatens quietly close to my ear , then he pulls me into an embrace , my back to his front , and kisses my hair . BACK IN THE HOUSE , Kate and Elliot are making their farewells to Grace and Mr. Grey. Kate hugs me hard . * I need to speak to you about antagonizing Christian , * I hiss quietly in her ear as she embraces me . * He needs antagonizing ; then you can see what he * s really like. Be careful , Ana * he * s so controlling , * she whispers. * See you later. * I KNOW WHAT HE * S REALLY LIKE * YOU DON * T ! I scream at her in my head. I * m fully aware that her actions come from a good place , but sometimes she just oversteps boundaries , and right now she * s so far over that she * s in the neighboring state. I scowl at her , and she pokes her tongue out at me , making me smile unwillingly. Playful Kate is novel ; must be Elliot * s influence. We wave them off at the doorway , and Christian turns to me . * We should go , too * you have interviews tomorrow. *"
