"not feel this embarrassed every time I recall the moment. I start babbling about my mother * anything to block that memory . * My mom is wonderful. She * s an incurable romantic. She * s currently on her fourth husband. * Christian raises his eyebrows in surprise . * I miss her , * I continue. * She has Bob now. I just hope he can keep an eye on her and pick up the pieces when her harebrained schemes don * t go as planned. * I smile fondly. I haven * t seen my mom for so long. Christian is watching me intently , taking occasional sips of his coffee. I really shouldn * t look at his mouth. It * s unsettling . * Do you get along with your stepfather ? * * Of course. I grew up with him. He * s the only father I know. * * And what * s he like ? * * Ray ? He * s * taciturn. * * That * s it ? * Grey asks , surprised . I shrug. What does this man expect ? My life story ? * Taciturn like his stepdaughter , * Grey prompts . I refrain from rolling my eyes at him . * He likes soccer * European soccer especially * and bowling , and fly-fishing , and making furniture. He * s a carpenter. Ex-army. * I sigh . * You lived with him ? * * Yes. My mom met Husband Number Three when I was fifteen. I stayed with Ray. * He frowns as if he doesn * t understand . * You didn * t want to live with your mom ? * he asks . This really is none of his business . * Husband Number Three lived in Texas. My home was in Montesano. And * you know , my mom was newly married. * I stop. My mom never talks about Husband Number Three. Where is Grey going with this ? This is none of his business. Two can play at this game . * Tell me about your parents , * I ask . He shrugs . * My dad * s a lawyer , my mom is a pediatrician. They live in Seattle. * Oh * he * s had an affluent upbringing. And I wonder about a successful couple who adopts three kids , and one of them turns into a beautiful man who takes on the business world and conquers it single-handed. What drove him to be that way ? His folks must be proud . * What do your siblings do ? * * Elliot * s in construction , and my little sister is in Paris , studying cookery under some renowned French chef. * His eyes cloud with irritation. He doesn * t want to talk about his family or himself . * I hear Paris is lovely , * I murmur."
