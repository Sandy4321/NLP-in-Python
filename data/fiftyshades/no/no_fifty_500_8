"it ? * * I don * t have a philosophy as such. Maybe a guiding principle * Carnegie * s : * A man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled. * I * m very singular , driven. I like control * of myself and those around me. * * So you want to possess things ? * You are a control freak . * I want to deserve to possess them , but yes , bottom line , I do. * * You sound like the ultimate consumer. * * I am. * He smiles , but the smile doesn * t touch his eyes. Again , this is at odds with someone who wants to feed the world , so I can * t help thinking that we * re talking about something else , but I * m mystified as to what it is. I swallow hard. The temperature in the room is rising , or maybe it * s just me. I just want this interview to be over. Surely Kate has enough material now. I glance at the next question . * You were adopted. How much do you think that * s shaped the way you are ? * Oh , this is personal. I stare at him , hoping he * s not offended. His brow furrows . * I have no way of knowing. * My interest is piqued. * How old were you when you were adopted ? * * That * s a matter of public record , Miss Steele. * His tone is stern. Crap. Yes , of course * if I * d known I was doing this interview , I would have done some research. Flustered , I move on quickly . * You * ve had to sacrifice family life for your work. * * That * s not a question. * He * s terse . * Sorry. * I squirm ; he * s made me feel like an errant child. I try again. * Have you had to sacrifice family life for your work ? * * I have a family. I have a brother and a sister and two loving parents. I * m not interested in extending my family beyond that. * * Are you gay , Mr. Grey ? * He inhales sharply , and I cringe , mortified. Crap. Why didn * t I employ some kind of filter before I read this straight out ? How can I tell him I * m just reading the questions ? Damn Kate and her curiosity ! * No , Anastasia , I * m not. * He raises his eyebrows , a cool gleam in his eyes. He does not look pleased . * I apologize. It * s , um * written here. * It * s the first time"
