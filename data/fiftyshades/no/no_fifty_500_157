": May 23 2011 23 : 16 To : Anastasia Steele Miss Steele , I look forward to receiving your notes on the contract . Until then , sleep well , baby . Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : Issues Date : May 24 2011 00 : 02 To : Christian Grey Dear Mr. Grey , Here is my list of issues. I look forward to discussing them more fully at dinner on Wednesday . The numbers refer to clauses : 2 : Not sure why this is solely for MY benefit * i.e. , to explore MY sensuality and limits. I * m sure I wouldn * t need a ten-page contract to do that ! Surely this is for YOUR benefit . 4 : As you are aware , you are my only sexual partner. I don * t take drugs , and I * ve not had any blood transfusions. I * m probably safe. What about you ? 8 : I can terminate at any time if I don * t think you * re sticking to the agreed limits. Okay * I like this . 9 : Obey you in all things ? Accept without hesitation your discipline ? We need to talk about this . 11 : One-month trial period. Not three . 12 : I can not commit every weekend. I do have a life , or will have. Perhaps three out of four ? 15.2 : Using my body as you see fit sexually or otherwise * please define * or otherwise. * 15.5 : This whole discipline clause. I * m not sure I want to be whipped , flogged , or corporally punished. I am sure this would be in breach of clauses 2 * 5. And also * for any other reason. * That * s just mean * and you told me you weren * t a sadist . 15.10 : Like loaning me out to someone else would ever be an option. But I * m glad it * s here in black and white . 15.14 : The Rules. More on those later . 15.19 : Touching myself without your permission. What * s the problem with this ? You know I don * t do it anyway . 15.21 : Discipline * please see clause 15.5 above . 15.22 : I can * t look into your eyes ? Why ? 15.24 : Why can * t I touch you ? Rules : Sleep * I * ll agree to six hours . Food * I am not eating food from a prescribed list. The food list goes or I do * deal breaker . Clothes * as long as I only have to wear your clothes when I * m with you * okay . Exercise * We agreed on three hours , this still says four . Soft Limits : Can we go"
