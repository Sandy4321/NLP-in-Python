"me , tonight , * he breathes. * If you go away , I won * t see you all week. Please. * * Yes , * I acquiesce. * And I * ll try , too. I * ll sign your contract. * And it * s a spur-of-the-moment decision . He gazes down at me . * Sign after Georgia. Think about it. Think about it hard , baby. * * I will. * And we sit in silence for a mile or two . * You really should wear your seat belt , * Christian whispers disapprovingly into my hair , but he makes no move to shift me from his lap . I nuzzle up against him , eyes closed , my nose at his throat , drinking in his sexy Christian-and-spiced-musky-bodywash fragrance , my head on his shoulder. I let my mind drift , and I allow myself to fantasize that he loves me. Oh , and it * s so real , tangible almost , and a small part of my nasty harpy subconscious acts completely out of character and dares to hope. I * m careful not to touch his chest but just snuggle in his arms as he holds me tightly . All too soon , I * m torn from my impossible daydream . * We * re home , * Christian murmurs , and it * s such a tantalizing sentence , full of so much potential . Home , with Christian. Except his apartment is an art gallery , not a home . Taylor opens the door for us , and I thank him shyly , aware that he * s been within earshot of our conversation , but his kind smile is reassuring and gives nothing away. Once out of the car , Christian assesses me critically. Oh no * what have I done now ? * Why don * t you have a jacket ? * he frowns as he shrugs out of his and drapes it over my shoulders . Relief washes through me . * It * s in my new car , * I reply sleepily , yawning . He smirks at me . * Tired , Miss Steele ? * * Yes , Mr. Grey. * I feel bashful under his teasing scrutiny. Nevertheless I feel an explanation is in order. * I * ve been prevailed upon in ways I never thought possible today. * * Well , if you * re really unlucky , I may prevail upon you some more , * he promises as he takes my hand and leads me into the building. Holy shit * Again ! I gaze up at him in the elevator. I have assumed he * d like me to sleep with him , and then I remember that he doesn * t sleep with anyone , although he has with me a few times. I frown , and abruptly his gaze darkens."
