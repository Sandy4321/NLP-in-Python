"over at Becca * s. I * ll go fetch it. And yes , I * d love some tea. * Kate races out of the kitchen . Phew , Katherine Kavanagh sidetracked. I slice a bagel and pop it into the toaster. I flush , remembering my vivid dream. What on Earth was that about ? Last night I found it hard to sleep. My head was buzzing with various options. I am so confused. Christian * s idea of a relationship is more like a job offer. It has set hours , a job description , and a rather harsh grievance procedure. It * s not how I envisaged my first romance * but , of course , Christian doesn * t do romance. If I tell him I want more , he may say no * and I could jeopardize what he has offered. And this is what concerns me most , because I don * t want to lose him. But I * m not sure I have the stomach to be his submissive * deep down , it * s the canes and whips that put me off. I * m a physical coward , and I will go a long way to avoid pain. I think of my dream * is that what it would be like ?

I concentrate on my bagel and listen patiently as she runs through her valedictorian speech . I AM DRESSED AND ready when Ray arrives. I open the front door , and he * s standing on the porch in his ill-fitting suit. A warm surge of gratitude and love for this uncomplicated man streaks through me , and I throw my arms around him in an uncharacteristic display of affection. He * s taken aback , bemused . * Hey , Annie , I * m pleased to see you , too , * he mutters as he hugs me. Setting me back down , his hands on my shoulders , he looks me up and down , his brow furrowed. * You okay , kid ? * * Of course , Dad. Can * t a girl be pleased to see her old man ? * He smiles , his dark eyes crinkling at the corners , and follows me into the living room . * You look good , * he says . * This is Kate * s dress. * I glance down at the gray chiffon halter-neck dress . He frowns . * Where is Kate ? * * She * s gone to campus. She * s giving a speech , so she has to be early. * * Should we head on over ? * * Dad , we have half an hour. Would you like some tea ? And you can tell me how everyone"
