"on the ornate post of the bed . * Stand still , * he orders , and he kisses my behind and then gently nips me twice , making me tense. * Now lie down. Face up , * he adds as he smacks me hard on the behind , making me jump . Hastily , I crawl onto the bed * s hard , unyielding mattress and lie down , looking up at him. The satin of the sheet beneath me is soft and cool against my skin. His face is impassive , except for his eyes , which glow with a barely leashed excitement . * Hands above your head , * he orders , and I do as I * m bid . Jeez , my body hungers for him. I want him already . He turns , and out of the corner of my eyes , I watch him saunter back over to the chest of drawers , returning with the iPod and what looks like an eye mask , similar to the one I used on my flight to Atlanta. The thought makes me want to smile , but I can * t quite make my lips cooperate. I am too consumed with anticipation. I just know my face is completely immobile , my eyes huge , as I gaze at him .

I can still hear him , though the sound is muffled as he rises from the bed. I * m deafened by my own breathing * it * s shallow and erratic , reflecting my excitement. Christian takes my left arm , stretches it gently to the left-hand corner , and attaches the leather cuff around my wrist. His long fingers stroke the length of my arm once he * s finished. Oh ! His touch elicits a delicious , tickly shiver. I hear him move slowly around to the other side ,"
