"cool , bright May moon etches a sparkling silver path across the water toward a jetty where two boats are moored. Beside the jetty stands a boathouse. It is so picturesque , so peaceful. I stand and gape for a moment . Christian pulls me behind him , and my heels sink into the soft grass . * Stop , please. * I am stumbling in his wake . He stops and gazes at me , his expression unfathomable . * My heels. I need to take my shoes off. * * Don * t bother , * he says , and he bends down and scoops me over his shoulder. I squeal loudly with shocked surprise , and he gives me a ringing slap on my behind . * Keep your voice down , * he growls . Oh no * this is not good. My subconscious is quaking at the knees. He * s mad about something * could be Jos * , Georgia , no panties , biting my lip. Jeez , he * s easy to rile . * Where are we going ? * I breathe . * Boathouse , * he snaps . I hang on to his hips as I * m tipped upside down , and he strides purposefully in the moonlight across the lawn . * Why ? * I sound breathless , bouncing on this shoulder . * I need to be alone with you. * * What for ? * * Because I * m going to spank and then fuck you. * * Why ? * I whimper softly . * You know why , * he hisses . * I thought you were an in-the-moment guy ? * I plead breathlessly . * Anastasia , I * m in the moment , trust me. * Holy fuck . CHAPTER TWENTY Christian bursts through the wooden door of the boathouse and pauses to flick on some switches. Fluorescents ping and buzz in sequence as harsh white light floods the large wooden building. From my upside-down view , I can see an impressive cruiser in the dock floating gently on the dark water , but I only get a brief look before he * s carrying me up some wooden stairs to the room above . He pauses at the doorway and flips another switch * halogens , this time , that are softer , on a dimmer * and we * re in an attic room with sloping ceilings. It * s decorated with a nautical New England theme : navy blues and creams with dashes of red. The furnishings are sparse , just a couple of couches are all I can see . Christian sets me on my feet on the wooden floor. I don * t have time to examine my surroundings * my eyes can * t leave him. I am mesmerized * watching him like one would watch a rare and dangerous predator ,"
