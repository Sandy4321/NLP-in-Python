I peek up at him . * Well , you know a lot more about me now , * he snaps , his mouth presses into a hard line. * I knew you were inexperienced , but a virgin ! * He says it like it * s a really dirty word. * Hell , Ana , I just showed you * * he groans. * May God forgive me. Have you ever been kissed , apart from by me ? * * Of course I have. * I try my best to look affronted. Okay * maybe twice . * And a nice young man hasn * t swept you off your feet ? I just don * t understand. You * re twenty-one , nearly twenty-two. You * re beautiful. * He runs his hand through his hair again . Beautiful. I flush with pleasure.

I like having you here. * He frowns as he says this and then glances at his watch. * It * s late. * And he turns to look at me. * You * re biting your lip. * His voice is husky , and he * s eyeing me speculatively . * Sorry. * * Don * t apologize. It * s just that I want to bite it , too , hard. * I gasp * how can he say things like that to me and not expect me to be affected . * Come , * he murmurs . * What ? * * We * re going to rectify the situation right now. * * What do you mean ? What situation ? * * Your situation. Ana ,"
