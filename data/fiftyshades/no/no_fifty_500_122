"Grigio , * Christian says with a voice of authority. I purse my lips , exasperated . * What ? * he snaps . * I wanted a Diet Coke , * I whisper . His gray eyes narrow , and he shakes his head . * The Pinot Grigio here is a decent wine. It will go well with the meal , whatever we get , * he says patiently . * Whatever we get ? * * Yes. * He smiles his dazzling head-cocked-to-one-side smile , and my stomach pole vaults over my spleen. I can * t help but reflect his glorious smile back at him . * My mother liked you , * he says dryly . * Really ? * His words make me flush with pleasure . * Oh yes. She * s always thought I was gay. * My mouth drops open , and I remember that question * from the interview. Oh no . * Why did she think you were gay ? * I whisper . * Because she * s never seen me with a girl. * * Oh * not even one of the fifteen ? * He smiles . * You remembered. No , none of the fifteen. * * Oh. * * You know , Anastasia , it * s been a weekend of firsts for me , too , * he says quietly . * It has ? * * I * ve never slept with anyone , never had sex in my bed , never flown a girl in Charlie Tango , never introduced a woman to my mother. What are you doing to me ? * His eyes burn , their intensity takes my breath away . The waitress arrives with our glasses of wine , and I immediately take a quick sip. Is he opening up or just making a casual observation ? * I * ve really enjoyed this weekend , * I murmur. He narrows his eyes at me again . * Stop biting that lip , * he growls. * Me , too , * he adds . * What * s vanilla sex ? * I ask , if anything to distract myself from the intense , burning , sexy look he * s giving me. He laughs . * Just straightforward sex , Anastasia. No toys , no add-ons. * He shrugs. * You know * well , actually you don * t , but that * s what it means. * * Oh. * I thought it was chocolate fudge brownie sex that we had , with a cherry on the top. But hey , what do I know ? The waitress brings us soup. We both stare at it rather dubiously . * Nettle soup , * the waitress informs us before turning and flouncing back into the kitchen. I don * t think she likes to be ignored by Christian. I take a tentative taste."
