"deep down , brimming fullness * the vehement sensation pulsing through me that * s building quickly , I watch him , our eyes locked * and I see wonder there , wonder at me . I am fucking him. I am in charge. He * s mine , and I * m his. The thought pushes me , weighted with concrete , over the edge , and I climax around him * shouting incoherently. He grabs my hips , and closing his eyes , tipping his head back , his jaw strained , he comes quietly. I collapse on to his chest , overwhelmed , somewhere between fantasy and reality , a place where there are no hard or soft limits . CHAPTER SIXTEEN Slowly the outside world invades my senses , and oh my , what an invasion. I am floating , my limbs soft and languid , utterly spent. I * m lying on top of him , my head on his chest , and he smells divine : freshly laundered linen and some expensive body wash and the best , most seductive scent on the planet * Christian. I don * t want to move , I want to breathe this elixir for eternity. I nuzzle him , wishing I didn * t have the barrier of his T-shirt. And as rhyme and reason return to the rest of my body , I stretch my hand out on his chest. This is the first time I * ve touched him here. He * s firm * strong. His hand swoops up and grabs mine , but he softens the blow by pulling it to his mouth and sweetly kissing my knuckles. He rolls over so he * s gazing down at me . * Don * t , * he murmurs , then kisses me lightly . * Why don * t you like to be touched ? * I whisper , staring up into soft gray eyes . * Because I * m fifty shades of fucked up , Anastasia. * Oh * his honesty is completely disarming. I blink up at him . * I had a very tough introduction to life. I don * t want to burden you with the details. Just don * t. * He strokes his nose against mine , and then he pulls out of me and sits up . * I think that * s all the very basics covered. How was that ? * He looks thoroughly pleased with himself and sounds very matter-of-fact at the same time , like he * s just marked off another item on a checklist. I * m still reeling from the * tough introduction to life * comment. It * s so frustrating * I am desperate to know more. But he won * t tell me. I cock my head to one side , like he does , and make an enormous effort to smile at him ."
