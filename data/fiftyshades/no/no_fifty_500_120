"his eyes at me . * Talk to her if you must. * He sounds exasperated. * Make sure she doesn * t mention anything to Elliot. * I bristle at his insinuation. Kate isn * t like that . * She wouldn * t do that , and I wouldn * t tell you anything she tells me about Elliot * if she were to tell me anything , * I add quickly . * Well , the difference is that I don * t want to know about his sex life , * Christian murmurs dryly. * Elliot * s a nosy bastard. But only about what we * ve done so far , * he warns. * She * d probably have my balls if she knew what I wanted to do to you , * he adds so softly I * m not sure I * m supposed to hear it . * Okay , * I agree readily , smiling up at him , relieved. The thought of Kate with Christian * s balls is not something I want to dwell on . His lip quirks up at me , and he shakes his head . * The sooner I have your submission the better , and we can stop all this , * he murmurs . * Stop all what ? * * You , defying me. * He reaches down and cups my chin and plants a swift , sweet kiss on my lips as the doors to the elevator open. He grabs my hand and leads me into the underground garage . Me , defying him * how ? Beside the elevator , I can see the black 4x4 Audi , but it * s the sleek black sporty number that blips open and lights up when he points the key fob at it. It * s one of those cars that should have a very leggy blonde , wearing nothing but a sash , sprawled across the hood . * Nice car , * I murmur dryly . He glances up and grins . * I know , * he says , and for a split second sweet , young , carefree Christian is back. It warms my heart. He * s so excited. Boys and their toys. I roll my eyes at him but can * t stifle my smile. He opens the door for me and I climb in. Whoa * it * s low. He moves around the car with easy grace , and folds his long frame elegantly in beside me. How does he do that ? * So what sort of car is this ? * * It * s an Audi R8 Spyder. It * s a lovely day ; we can take the top down. There * s a baseball cap in there. In fact there should be two. * He points to the glove box. * And sunglasses if you want them. *"
