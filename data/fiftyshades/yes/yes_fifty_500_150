"* He * s driving me insane. I hear him smile . The ice in my navel is melting. I am beyond warm * warm and chilled and wanting. Wanting him , inside me. Now . His cool fingers trail languidly across my belly. My skin is oversensitive , my hips flex automatically , and the now-warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly.
