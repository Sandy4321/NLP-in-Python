"wrong things. * * Wrong ? Not to me. * He shakes his head. He looks so sincere. * Try it , * he whispers. A challenge , daring me , and he cocks his head to one side and smiles his crooked , dazzling smile . I gasp , and I * m Eve in the Garden of Eden , and he * s the serpent , and I can not resist . * Okay , * I whisper . * What ? * I have his full , undivided attention. I swallow . * Okay. I * ll try. * * You * re agreeing ? * His disbelief is evident . * Subject to the soft limits , yes. I * ll try. * My voice is so small. Christian closes his eyes and pulls me into an embrace . * Jesus , Ana , you * re so unexpected. You take my breath away. * He steps back , and suddenly Ray * s returned , and the volume in the marquee gradually rises and fills my ears. We are not alone. Holy shit , I * ve just agreed to be his sub. Christian smiles at Ray and his eyes are dancing with joy . * Annie , should we get some lunch ? * * Okay. * I blink up at Ray , trying to find my equilibrium. What have you done ? my subconscious screams at me. My inner goddess is doing backflips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast . * Would you like to join us , Christian ? * Ray asks . Christian ! I stare up at him , imploring him to refuse. I need space to think * what the fuck have I done ? * Thank you , Mr. Steele , but I have plans. It * s been great to meet you , sir. * * Likewise , * Ray responds. * Look after my baby girl. * * Oh , I fully intend to. * They shake hands. I feel sick. Ray has no idea how Christian intends to look after me. Christian takes my hand and brings it to his lips and kisses my knuckles tenderly , his scorching eyes intent on mine . * Later , Miss Steele , * he breathes , his voice full of promise . My belly curls at the thought. Hang on * later ? Ray takes my elbow and leads me toward the entrance to the tent . * Seems a solid young man. Well off , too. You could do a lot worse , Annie. Though why I had to hear about him from Katherine * * he scolds . I shrug apologetically . * Well , any man who likes and knows his fly-fishing is okay with me. * Holy cow * Ray approves. If only he knew . RAY DROPS ME BACK at the house at dusk . * Call your mom"
