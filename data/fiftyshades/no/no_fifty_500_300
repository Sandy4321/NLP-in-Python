"Make our agreement a year ? I have the power ! Jeez , I * m going to have to think about that. Take him literally , that * s what my mother says. He doesn * t want to lose me. He * s said that twice ! He wants to make this work , too. Oh , Christian , so do I ! He * s going to try to stay away ! Does this mean he might fail to stay away ? Suddenly , I hope so. I want to see him. We * ve been apart less than twenty-four hours , and knowing that I can * t see him for four days , I realize how much I miss him. How much I love him . * Ana , honey. * The voice is soft and warm , full of love and sweet memories of times gone by . A gentle hand brushes my face. My mom wakes me , and I * m wrapped around my laptop , hugging it to me . * Ana , sweetheart , * she continues in her soft , singsong voice while I surface from sleep , blinking in the pale pink light of dusk . * Hi , Mom. * I stretch out and smile . * We * re going out for dinner in thirty minutes. You still want to come ? * she asks kindly . * Oh yes , Mom , of course. * I try very hard but fail to stifle my yawn . * Now that * s an impressive piece of technology. * She points to my laptop . Oh , crap . * Oh * this ? * I strive for casual , surprised nonchalance . Will Mom notice ? She seems to have grown more astute since I acquired a * boyfriend. * * Christian lent it to me. I think I could pilot the space shuttle with it , but I just use it for e-mails and Internet access. * Really , it * s nothing. Eyeing me suspiciously , she sits down on the bed and tucks a stray lock of hair behind my ear . * Has he e-mailed you ? * Oh , double crap . * Yeah. * My nonchalance is wearing thin , and I flush . * Perhaps he * s missing you , huh ? * * I hope so , Mom. * * What does he say ? * Oh , triple crap. I frantically try to think of something acceptable from that e-mail I can tell my mother. I * m sure she doesn * t want to hear about Doms and bondage and gagging , but then I can * t tell her because there * s the NDA . * He * s told me to enjoy myself but not too much. * * Sounds reasonable. I * ll leave you to get ready , honey. *"
