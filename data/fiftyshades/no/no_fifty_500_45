"* Which bar ? * He sounds exasperated . * A bar in Portland. * * How are you getting home ? * * I * ll find a way. * This conversation is not going how I expected . * Which bar are you in ? * * Why did you send me the books , Christian ? * * Anastasia , where are you ? Tell me now. * His tone is so * so dictatorial , his usual control freak. I imagine him as an old-time movie director wearing jodhpurs , holding an old-fashioned megaphone and a riding crop. The image makes me laugh out loud . * You * re so * domineering. * I giggle . * Ana , so help me , where the fuck are you ? * Christian Grey is swearing at me.

I wait at the bar for what feels like an eternity for the pitcher of beer and eventually return to the table . * You * ve been gone so long , * Kate scolds me. * Where were you ? * * I was in line for the restroom. * Jos *"
