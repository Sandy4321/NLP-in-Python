"have a coat ? * Grey asks . * A jacket. * Olivia leaps up and retrieves my jacket , which Grey takes from her before she can hand it to me. He holds it up and , feeling ridiculously self-conscious , I shrug it on. Grey places his hands for a moment on my shoulders. I gasp at the contact. If he notices my reaction , he gives nothing away. His long index finger presses the button summoning the elevator , and we stand waiting * awkwardly on my part , coolly self-possessed on his. The doors open , and I hurry in , desperate to escape. I really need to get out of here. When I turn to look at him , he * s gazing at me and leaning against the doorway beside the elevator with one hand on the wall. He really is very , very good-looking. It * s unnerving . * Anastasia , * he says as a farewell . * Christian , * I reply. And mercifully , the doors close . CHAPTER TWO My heart is pounding. The elevator arrives on the first floor , and I scramble out as soon as the doors slide open , stumbling once but fortunately not sprawling onto the immaculate sandstone floor. I race for the wide glass doors , and suddenly I * m free in the bracing , cleansing , damp air of Seattle. Raising my face , I welcome the cool , refreshing rain. I close my eyes and take a deep , purifying breath , trying to recover what * s left of my equilibrium . No man has ever affected me the way Christian Grey has , and I can not fathom why. Is it his looks ? His civility ? Wealth ? Power ? I don * t understand my irrational reaction. I breathe an enormous sigh of relief. What in heaven * s name was that all about ? Leaning against one of the steel pillars of the building , I valiantly attempt to calm down and gather my thoughts. I shake my head. What was that ? My heart steadies to its regular rhythm , and when I can breathe normally again I head for the car . AS I LEAVE THE city limits behind , I begin to feel foolish and embarrassed as I replay the interview in my mind. Surely I * m overreacting to something that * s imaginary. Okay , so he * s very attractive , confident , commanding , at ease with himself * but on the flip side , he * s arrogant , and for all his impeccable manners , he * s autocratic and cold. Well , on the surface. An involuntary shiver runs down my spine. He may be arrogant , but then he has a right to be * he * s accomplished so much at such a young age. He doesn * t suffer fools gladly"
