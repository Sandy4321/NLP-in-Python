"laughing * and he joins me . * Maybe I don * t have a good teacher. * He snorts. * Maybe. Perhaps I should be stricter with you. * He cocks his head to one side and gives me an artful smile . I swallow. Jeez , no. But at the same time , my muscles clench deliciously deep inside. It is his way of showing that he cares. Perhaps the only way he can show he cares * I realize that. He * s staring at me , gauging my reaction . * Was it that bad when I spanked you the first time ? * I gaze back at him , blinking. Was it that bad ? I remember feeling confused by my reaction. It hurt , but not that much in retrospect. He * s said over and over again it * s more in my head. And the second time * Well , that was good * hot . * No , not really , * I whisper . * It * s more the idea of it ? * he prompts . * I suppose. Feeling pleasure , when one isn * t supposed to. * * I remember feeling the same. Takes a while to get your head around it. * Holy hell. This was when he was a kid . * You can always use the safeword , Anastasia. Don * t forget that. And , as long as you follow the rules , which fulfill a deep need in me for control and to keep you safe , then perhaps we can find a way forward. * * Why do you need to control me ? * * Because it satisfies a need in me that wasn * t met in my formative years. * * So it * s a form of therapy ? * * I * ve not thought of it like that , but yes , I suppose it is. * This I can understand. This will help . * But , here * s the thing * one moment you say * don * t defy me , * the next you say you like to be challenged. That * s a very fine line to tread successfully. * He gazes at me for a moment , then frowns . * I can see that. But you seem to be doing fine so far. * * But at what personal cost ? I * m tied up in knots here. * * I like you tied up in knots. * He smirks . * That * s not what I meant ! * I splash him in exasperation . He gazes down at me , arching an eyebrow . * Did you just splash me ? * * Yes. * Holy shit * that look . * Oh , Miss Steele. * He grabs me and pulls me onto his lap , sloshing water all over"
