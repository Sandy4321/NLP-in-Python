"one arm around me . * Mr. Kavanagh. * They shake hands. Christian holds his hand out to me . * Ana , baby , * he murmurs , and I nearly expire at the endearment . I walk out of Ethan * s grasp , while Christian smiles icily at him , and I take my place at his side. Kate grins at me. She knows exactly what she * s doing , the vixen ! * Ethan , Mom and Dad wanted a word. * Kate drags Ethan away . * So how long have you kids known each other ? * Ray looks impassively from Christian to me . The power of speech has deserted me. I want the ground to swallow me up. Christian puts his arm around me , his thumb skimming my naked back in a caress , before his hand clasps my shoulder . * Couple of weeks or so now , * he says smoothly. * We met when Anastasia came to interview me for the student newspaper. * * Didn * t know you worked on the student newspaper , Ana. * Ray * s voice is a quiet admonishment , revealing his irritation. Shit . * Kate was ill , * I murmur. It * s all I can manage . * Fine speech you gave , Mr. Grey. * * Thank you , sir. I understand that you * re a keen fisherman. * Ray raises his eyebrows and smiles * a rare , genuine , bona fide Ray Steele smile * and off they go , talking fish. In fact , I soon feel surplus to requirements. He * s charming the pants off my dad * like he did you , my subconscious snaps at me. His power knows no bounds. I excuse myself to go and find Kate . She * s talking to her parents , who are delightful as ever and greet me warmly. We exchange brief pleasantries , mostly about their up and coming vacation to Barbados and about our move . * Kate , how could you out me to Ray ? * I hiss at the first opportunity we won * t be overheard . * Because I knew you never would , and I want to help with Christian * s commitment issues. * Kate smiles at me sweetly . I scowl. It * s me that won * t commit to him , silly ! * He seems tr * s cool about it , Ana. Don * t sweat it. Look at him now * Christian can not take his eyes off you. * I glance up , and both Ray and Christian are looking at me. * He * s been watching you like a hawk. * * I * d better go rescue Ray , or Christian. I don * t know which. You haven * t heard the last of this , Katherine Kavanagh !"
