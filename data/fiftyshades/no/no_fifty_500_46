"and Levi are having some heated debate about our local baseball team. Jos * pauses in his tirade to pour us all beers , and I take a long sip . * Kate , I think I * d better step outside and get some fresh air. * * Ana , you are such a lightweight. * * I * ll be five minutes. * I make my way through the crowd again. I am beginning to feel nauseated , my head is spinning uncomfortably , and I * m a little unsteady on my feet. More unsteady than usual . Drinking in the cool evening air in the parking lot makes me realize how drunk I am. My vision has been affected , and I * m really seeing double of everything like in old reruns of Tom and Jerry cartoons. I think I * m going to be sick. Why did I let myself get this messed up ? * Ana , * Jos * has joined me. * You okay ? * * I think I * ve just had a bit too much to drink. * I smile weakly at him . * Me , too , * he murmurs , and his dark eyes are regarding me intently. * Do you need a hand ? * he asks and steps closer , putting his arm around me . * Jos * , I * m okay. I * ve got this. * I try to push him away rather feebly . * Ana , please , * he whispers , and now he * s holding me in his arms , pulling me close . * Jos * , what are you doing ? * * You know I like you Ana , please. * He has one hand at the small of my back holding me against him , the other at my chin tipping back my head. Holy fuck * he * s going to kiss me . * No , Jos * , stop * no. * I push him , but he * s a wall of hard muscle , and I can not shift him. His hand has slipped into my hair , and he * s holding my head in place . * Please , Ana , cari * o , * he whispers against my lips. His breath is soft and smells too sweet * of margarita and beer. He gently trails kisses along my jaw up to the side of my mouth. I feel panicky , drunk , and out of control. The feeling is suffocating . * Jos * , no , * I plead. I don * t want this. You are my friend , and I think I * m going to throw up . * I think the lady said no , * a voice in the dark says quietly. Holy shit ! Christian Grey , he * s here. How ? Jos"
