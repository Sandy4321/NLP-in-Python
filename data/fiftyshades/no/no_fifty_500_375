"comparison. Is that enough for him ? I sob harder into the pillow. I am going to lose him. He won * t want to be with me if I can * t give him this. Why , why , why have I fallen in love with Fifty Shades ? Why ? Why can * t I love Jos * , or Paul Clayton , or someone like me ? Oh , his distraught look as I left. I was so cruel , shocked by the savagery * will he forgive me * will I forgive him ? My thoughts are all haywire and jumbled , echoing and bouncing off the inside of my skull.

My heart clenches anew and releases a fresh wave of silent sobbing. He continues to kiss me softly , tenderly , but I remain aloof and wary . We lie together like this , neither saying anything for ages. He just holds me , and very gradually , I relax and stop crying. Dawn comes and goes , and the soft light gets brighter as morning moves on , and still we lie quietly . * I brought you some Advil and some arnica cream , * he says"
