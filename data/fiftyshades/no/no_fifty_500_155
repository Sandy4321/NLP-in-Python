"he whispers. * What are you doing to me ? * * I could say the same to you , * I whisper back . Taking a deep breath , he kisses my forehead and leaves. He strolls purposefully down the path toward his car as he runs his hand through his hair. Glancing up as he opens his car door , he smiles his breathtaking smile. My answering smile is weak , completely dazzled by him , and I * m reminded once more of Icarus soaring too close to the sun. I close the front door as he climbs into his sports car. I have an overwhelming urge to cry ; a sad and lonely melancholy grips and tightens around my heart. Dashing back to my bedroom , I close the door and lean against it , trying to rationalize my feelings. I can * t. Sliding to the floor , I put my head in my hands as my tears begin to flow . Kate knocks gently . * Ana ? * she whispers. I open the door. She takes one look at me and throws her arms around me . * What * s wrong ? What did that creepy good-looking bastard do ? * * Oh , Kate , nothing I didn * t want him to. * She pulls me to my bed and we sit . * You have dreadful sex hair. * In spite of my poignant sadness , I laugh . * It was good sex , not dreadful at all. * Kate smiles . * That * s better. Why are you crying ? You never cry. * She retrieves my brush from the side table and , sitting behind me , very slowly starts brushing out the knots . * I just don * t think our relationship is going to go anywhere. * I stare down at my fingers . * I thought you said you were going to see him on Wednesday ? * * I am. That was our original plan. * * So , why did he turn up here today ? * * I sent him an e-mail. * * Asking him to drop by ? * * No , saying I didn * t want to see him anymore. * * And he turns up ? Ana , that * s genius. * * Actually , it was a joke. * * Oh. Now I * m really confused. * Patiently , I explain the essence of my e-mail without giving anything away . * So you thought he * d reply by e-mail. * * Yes. * * But instead he turns up here. * * Yes. * * I * d say he * s completely smitten with you. * I frown. Christian smitten with me ? Hardly. He * s just looking for a new toy * a convenient new toy that he can bed and do unspeakable things to."
