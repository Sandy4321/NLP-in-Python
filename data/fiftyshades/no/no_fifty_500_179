"Look at him ! * one of the girls beside me hisses enthusiastically to her friend . * He * s hot. * I stiffen. I * m sure they * re not talking about Professor Collins . * Must be Christian Grey. * * Is he single ? * I bristle. * I don * t think so , * I murmur . * Oh. * Both girls look at me in surprise . * I think he * s gay , * I mutter . * What a shame , * one of the girls groans . As the chancellor gets to his feet and kicks off the proceedings with his speech , I watch Christian subtly scanning the hall. I sink into my seat , hunching my shoulders , trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible. I fail miserably as a second later his eyes find mine. He stares at me , his face impassive , completely inscrutable. I squirm uncomfortably , hypnotized by his glare as a slow flush spreads across my face. Unbidden , I recall my dream from this morning , and the muscles in my belly do the delectable clench thing. I inhale sharply. The shadow of a smile crosses his lips , but it * s fleeting. He briefly closes his eyes and , on opening them , resumes his indifferent expression. Following a swift glance up at the chancellor , he stares ahead , focusing on the WSUV emblem hung above the entrance. He doesn * t turn his eyes toward me again. The chancellor drones on , and Christian still doesn * t look at me. He just stares fixedly ahead . Why won * t he look at me ? Perhaps he * s changed his mind ? A wave of unease washes over me. Perhaps walking out on him last night was the end for him , too. He * s bored of waiting for me to make up my mind. Oh no , I could have completely blown it. I remember his e-mail last night. Maybe he * s mad that I haven * t replied . Suddenly , the room erupts into applause as Miss Katherine Kavanagh has taken the stage. The chancellor sits , and Kate tosses her lovely long hair behind her as she places her papers on the lectern. She takes her time , not intimidated by a thousand people staring at her. She smiles when she * s ready , looks up at the captivated throng , and launches eloquently into her speech. She * s composed and funny , the girls beside me erupt on cue at her first joke. Oh , Katherine Kavanagh , you can deliver a good line. I am so proud of her at that moment , my errant thoughts of Christian pushed to one side. Even though I have heard her speech before , I listen carefully. She commands the room and takes her audience"
