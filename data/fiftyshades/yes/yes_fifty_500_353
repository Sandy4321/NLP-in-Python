", the intensity of feeling * it * s almost painful. My body starts to quicken , and he releases me. What ? No ! My breathing is ragged as I pant , gazing at him with delicious anticipation. He grabs my face with both hands , holding me firmly , and he kisses me hard , thrusting his tongue into my mouth so I can taste my arousal. Unzipping his fly , he frees himself , grabs the backs of my thighs , and lifts me . * Wrap your legs around me , baby , * he commands , his voice urgent , strained . I do as I * m told and wrap my arms around his neck , and he moves quickly and sharply , filling me. Ah ! He gasps , and I groan. Holding my behind , his fingers digging into my soft flesh , he begins to move , slowly at first * a steady even tempo * but as his control unravels , he speeds up * faster and faster. Ahhh ! I tip my head back and concentrate on the invading , punishing , heavenly sensation * pushing me , pushing me * onward , higher , up * and when I can take no more , I explode around him , spiraling into an intense , all-consuming orgasm. He lets go with a deep growl , and he buries his head in my neck as he buries himself inside me , groaning loudly and incoherently as he finds his release . His breathing is erratic , but he kisses me tenderly , not moving , still inside me , and I blink , unseeing , into his eyes. As he comes into focus , he gently pulls out of me , holding me steady while I place my feet on the floor. The bathroom is now cloudy with steam * and hot. I feel overdressed . * You seem pleased to see me , * I murmur with a shy smile . His lips quirk up. * Yes , Miss Steele , I think my pleasure is pretty self-evident. Come * let me get you in the shower. * He undoes the next three buttons of his shirt , removes the cuff links , tugs it over his head , and discards it on the floor. Taking off his suit pants and boxer briefs , he kicks them to one side. He begins to undo the buttons on my blouse while I watch him , yearning to reach out and stroke his chest , but I contain myself . * How was your journey ? * he asks mildly. He seems so much calmer now , his apprehension gone , dissolved by sexual congress . * Fine , thank you , * I murmur , still breathless. * Thanks once again for first class. It really is a much nicer way to travel. * I smile shyly at him. *"
