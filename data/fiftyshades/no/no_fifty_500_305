"her * is she married ? Divorced ? Jeez * does she have children of her own ? Does she have Christian * s children ? My subconscious rears her ugly head , leering , and I * m shocked and nauseated at the thought. Does Dr. Flynn know about her ? I struggle out of bed and fire the mean machine up again. I am on a mission. I drum my fingers impatiently waiting for the blue screen to appear. I hit Google images and enter * Christian Grey * into the search engine. The screen is suddenly littered with images of Christian : in black tie , be-suited , jeez * Jos * * s pictures from the Heathman , in his white shirt and flannel trousers. How did they get on the Internet ? Boy , he looks good . I move quickly on : some with business associates , then picture after glorious picture of the most photogenic man I know intimately. Intimately ? Do I know Christian intimately ? I know him sexually , and I figure there * s a lot more to discover there. I know he * s moody , difficult , funny , cold , warm * jeez , the man is a walking mass of contradictions. I click to the next page. He * s still on his own in all these photographs , and I remember Kate mentioning that she couldn * t find any photographs of him with a date , prompting her gay question. Then , on the third page , there * s a picture of me , with him , at my graduation. His only picture with a woman , and it * s me . Holy cow ! I * m on Google ! I stare at us together. I look surprised by the camera , nervous , off balance. This was just before I agreed to try. For his part , Christian looks impossibly handsome , calm and collected , and he * s wearing that tie. I gaze at him , such a beautiful face , a beautiful face that could be staring at Mrs. Damned Robinson right now. I save the picture in my favorites and click through all eighteen pages of search results * nothing. I won * t find Mrs. Robinson on Google. But I have to know if he * s with her. I type a quick e-mail to Christian . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : Suitable Dinner Companions Date : May 31 2011 23 : 58 EST To : Christian Grey I hope you and your friend had a very pleasant dinner . Ana P.S. Was it Mrs. Robinson ? I press * send * and climb despondently back into bed , resolving to ask Christian about his relationship with that woman. Part of me is desperate to know more , and another part wants to forget he ever told me. And my period has started"
