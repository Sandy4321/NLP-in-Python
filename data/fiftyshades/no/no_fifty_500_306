", so I must remember to take my pill in the morning. I quickly program an alarm into the calendar on my BlackBerry. Setting it aside on the bedside table , I lie down and eventually drift into an uneasy sleep , wishing that we were in the same city , not twenty-five hundred miles apart . After a morning of shopping and an afternoon back at the beach , my mother has decreed we should spend the evening in a bar. Abandoning Bob to the TV , we find ourselves in the upscale bar of Savannah * s most exclusive hotel. I am on my second Cosmopolitan. My mother is on her third. She is offering more insights into the fragile male ego. It * s very disconcerting . * You see , Ana , men think that anything that comes out of a woman * s mouth is a problem to be solved. Not some vague idea that we * d like to kick around and talk about for a while and then forget. Men prefer action. * * Mom , why are you telling me this ? * I ask , failing to hide my exasperation. She * s been like this all day . * Darling , you sound so lost. You * ve never brought a boy home. You never even had a boyfriend when we were in Vegas. I thought something might develop with that guy you met in college , Jos * . * * Mom , Jos * * s just a friend. * * I know , sweetheart. But something * s up , and I don * t think you * re telling me everything. * She gazes at me , her face etched with motherly concern . * I just needed some distance from Christian to get my thoughts straight * that * s all. He tends to overwhelm me. * * Overwhelm ? * * Yeah. I miss him , though. * I frown . I have not heard from Christian all day. No e-mails , nothing. I am tempted to call him to see if he * s okay. My worst fear is that he * s been in a car accident ; my second worst fear is that Mrs. Robinson has gotten her evil claws into him again. I know it * s irrational , but where she * s concerned , I seem to have lost all sense of perspective . * Darling , I have to visit the restroom. * My mother * s brief absence allows me another chance to check my BlackBerry. I have been trying surreptitiously to check my e-mail all day. Finally * a response from Christian !
