". * Christian , it * s lovely to meet you finally , * Mom interjects , finally finding her voice. * Ana has spoken very fondly of you. * He smiles at her. * Really ? * He raises an eyebrow at me , an amused expression on his face , and I flush again . The waiter arrives with our drinks . * Hendricks , sir , * he says with a triumphant flourish . * Thank you , * Christian murmurs in acknowledgment . I sip my latest Cosmo nervously . * How long are you in Georgia , Christian ? * Mom asks . * Until Friday , Mrs. Adams. * * Will you have dinner with us tomorrow evening ?

What I needed. * * I don * t understand. * It * s my turn to look bewildered . * Anastasia , your mother will be back shortly. I * m not comfortable talking about this now. Later , maybe. If you don * t want me here , I have a plane on"
