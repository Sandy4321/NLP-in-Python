"ve never met. Gazing unseeing out the window , I nurse my irrational anger and jealousy . My mind drifts back to the afternoon. Given what I understand of his preferences , I think he * s been easy on me. Would I do it again ? I can * t even pretend to put up an argument against that. Of course I would , if he asked me * as long as he didn * t hurt me and if it * s the only way to be with him . That * s the bottom line. I want to be with him. My inner goddess sighs with relief. I reach the conclusion that she rarely uses her brain to think but another vital part of her anatomy , and at the moment , it * s a rather exposed part . * Don * t , * he murmurs . I frown and turn to look at him . * Don * t what ? * I haven * t touched him . * Overthink things , Anastasia. * Reaching out , he grasps my hand , draws it up to his lips , and kisses my knuckles gently. * I had a wonderful afternoon. Thank you. * And he * s back with me again. I blink up at him and smile shyly. He * s so confusing. I ask a question that * s been bugging me . * Why did you use a cable tie ? * He grins at me . * It * s quick , it * s easy , and it * s something different for you to feel and experience. I know they * re quite brutal , and I do like that in a restraining device. * He smiles at me mildly. * Very effective at keeping you in your place. * I flush and glance nervously at Taylor , who remains impassive , eyes on the road. What am I supposed to say to that ? Christian shrugs innocently . * All part of my world , Anastasia. * He squeezes my hand and lets go , staring out the window again . His world , indeed , and I want to belong in it , but on his terms ? I just don * t know. He hasn * t mentioned that damned contract. My inner musings do nothing to cheer me. I stare out the window and the landscape has changed. We * re crossing one of the bridges , surrounded by inky darkness. The somber night reflects my introspective mood , closing in , suffocating . I glance briefly at Christian , and he * s staring at me . * Penny for your thoughts ? * he asks . I sigh and frown . * That bad , huh ? * he says . * I wish I knew what you were thinking. * He smirks. * Ditto , baby , * he says"
