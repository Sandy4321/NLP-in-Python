"has someone with him. * * Oh * * Even I hear the disbelief in her voice . Christian blinks rapidly , staring down at me , wide-eyed with humored horror . * Shit ! It * s my mother. * CHAPTER TEN He pulls out of me suddenly. I wince. He sits up on the bed and throws the used condom in a wastebasket. * Come on , we need to get dressed * that * s if you want to meet my mother. * He grins , leaps up off the bed , and pulls on his jeans * no underwear ! I struggle to sit up as I * m still tethered . * Christian * I can * t move. * His grin widens , and leaning down , he undoes the tie. The woven pattern has made an indentation around my wrists. It * s * sexy. He gazes at me. He * s amused , his eyes dancing with mirth. He kisses my forehead quickly and beams at me . * Another first , * he acknowledges , but I have no idea what he * s talking about . * I have no clean clothes in here. * I am filled with sudden panic , and considering what I * ve just experienced , I * m finding the panic overwhelming. His mother ! Holy crap. I have no clean clothes , and she * s practically walked in on us in flagrante delicto. * Perhaps I should stay here. * * Oh no , you don * t , * Christian threatens. * You can wear something of mine. * He * s slipped on a white T-shirt and runs his hand through his just-fucked hair. In spite of my anxiety , I lose my train of thought. His beauty is derailing . * Anastasia , you could be wearing a sack and you * d look lovely. Please don * t worry. I * d like you to meet my mother. Get dressed. I * ll just go and calm her down. * His mouth presses into a hard line. * I will expect you in that room in five minutes , otherwise I * ll come and drag you out of here myself in whatever you * re wearing. My T-shirts are in this drawer. My shirts are in the closet. Help yourself. * He eyes me speculatively for a moment , then leaves the room . Holy shit. Christian * s mother. This is so much more than I bargained for. Perhaps meeting her will help put a little part of the jigsaw in place. Might help me understand why Christian is the way he is * Suddenly , I want to meet her. I pick up my shirt off the floor , and I * m pleased to discover that it has survived the night well with hardly any creases. I find my blue bra under the bed"
