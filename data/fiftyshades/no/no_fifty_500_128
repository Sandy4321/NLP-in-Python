"like I * ve been given a school assignment. Maybe I * ll be graded. I flush , remembering my A for this morning * s bath experiment . * Ana , what is it ? * * I * m just remembering something Christian said. * * You look different , * Kate says fondly . * I feel different. Sore , * I confess . * Sore ? * * A little. * I flush . * Me , too. Men , * she says in mock disgust. * They * re animals. * We both laugh . * You * re sore ? * I exclaim . * Yes * overuse. * I giggle . * Tell me about Elliot the overuser , * I ask when I * ve stopped giggling. Oh , I can feel myself relaxing for the first time since I was in line at the bar * before the phone call that started all this * when I was admiring Mr. Grey from afar. Happy , uncomplicated days . Kate blushes. Oh my * Katherine Agnes Kavanagh goes all Anastasia Rose Steele on me. She gives me a dewy-eyed look. I * ve never seen her react this way to a man before. My jaw drops to the floor. Where * s Kate ; what have you done with her ? * Oh , Ana , * she gushes. * He * s just so * everything. And when we * oh * really good. * She can hardly string a sentence together , she * s got it so bad . * I think you * re trying to tell me that you like him. * She nods , grinning like a lunatic . * And I * m seeing him on Saturday. He * s going to help us move. * She clasps her hands together , leaps up off the couch , and pirouettes to the window. Moving. Crap * I * d forgotten all about that , even with the packing cases surrounding us . * That * s helpful of him , * I say appreciatively. I can get to know him , too. Perhaps he can give me more insight into his strange , disturbing brother . * So what did you do last night ? * I ask. She cocks her head at me and raises her eyebrows in a what-do-you-think-stupid look . * Pretty much what you did , though we had dinner first. * She grins at me. * Are you okay really ? You look kind of overwhelmed. * * I feel overwhelmed. Christian is very intense. * * Yeah , I could see how he could be. But he was good to you ? * * Yes , * I reassure her. * I * m really hungry , shall I cook ? * She nods and picks up two more books to pack . * What do you want to"
