"* We aim to please , Miss Steele. * He smirks as we pull into the International House of Pancakes . * IHOP. * I grin back at him. I don * t believe it. Who would have thought * ? Christian Grey at IHOP . IT * S 8 : 30 A.M. BUT quiet in the restaurant. It smells of sweet batter , fried food , and disinfectant. Hmm * not such an enticing aroma. Christian leads me to a booth . * I would never have pictured you here , * I say as we slide into a booth . * My dad used to bring us to one of these whenever my mom went away to a medical conference. It was our secret. * He smiles at me , eyes dancing , then picks up a menu , running a hand through his wayward hair . Oh , I want to run my hands through that hair. I pick up a menu and examine it. I realize I * m starving . * I know what I want , * he breathes , his voice low and husky . I glance up at him , and he * s staring at me in that way that tightens all the muscles in my belly and takes my breath away , his eyes dark and smoldering. Holy shit. I gaze at him , my blood singing in my veins , answering his call . * I want what you want , * I whisper . He inhales sharply . * Here ? * he asks suggestively , raising an eyebrow at me , smiling wickedly , his teeth trapping the tip of his tongue . Oh my * sex in IHOP. His expression changes , growing darker . * Don * t bite your lip , * he orders. * Not here , not now. * His eyes harden momentarily , and for a moment , he looks so deliciously dangerous. * If I can * t have you here , don * t tempt me. * * Hi , my name * s Leandra. What can I get for you * er * folks * er * today , this mornin * * ? * Her voice trails off , stumbling over her words as she gets an eyeful of Mr. Beautiful opposite me. She flushes scarlet , and a small ounce of sympathy for her bubbles unwelcome into my consciousness because he still does that to me. Her presence allows me to escape briefly from his sensual glare . * Anastasia ? * he prompts me , ignoring her , and I don * t think anyone could squeeze as much carnality into my name as he does at that moment . I swallow , praying that I don * t turn the same color as poor Leandra . * I told you , I want what you want. * I keep my voice soft , low"
