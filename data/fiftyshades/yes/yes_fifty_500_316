"top button on my jeans and the zipper . * I * m going to have you in the bathroom , Anastasia. * Leaning down , he kisses my neck. I move my head to one side to give him easier access. Hooking his thumbs into my jeans , he slowly slides them down my legs , sinking down behind me as he pulls them and my panties to the floor . * Step out of your jeans. * Grasping the edge of the sink , I do just that. I am now naked , staring at myself , and he * s kneeling behind me. He kisses and then softly bites my behind , making me gasp. He stands and stares at me once more in the mirror. I try hard to stay still , ignoring my natural inclination to cover myself. He splays his hand across my belly , the span of his hand almost reaching from hip to hip . * Look at you.

Truly I am a marionette and he is the master puppeteer . * Look at you glow , Anastasia , * he whispers as he trails kisses and soft bites along my shoulder. I groan. Suddenly he lets go . * Carry on , * he orders , and stands"
