"You completely beguile me , Ana. You weave some powerful magic. * He releases my wrists , and I run my fingers through his hair , coming down from my high. I tighten my legs around him . * I * m the one beguiled , * I whisper . He gazes at me. His expression is disconcerted , alarmed even. Placing his hands on either side of my face , he holds my head in place . * You. Are. Mine , * he says , each word a staccato. * Do you understand ? * He * s so earnest , so impassioned * a zealot. The force of his plea is so unexpected and disarming. I wonder why he * s feeling like this. * Yes , yours , * I whisper , derailed by his fervor . * Are you sure you have to go to Georgia ? * I nod slowly. And in that brief moment , I watch his expression change and the shutters coming down. Abruptly he withdraws , making me wince . * Are you sore ? * he asks , leaning over me . * A little , * I confess . * I like you sore. * His eyes smolder. * Reminds you where I * ve been , and only me. * He grabs my chin and kisses me roughly , then stands and holds his hand out to help me up. I glance down at the foil packet beside me . * Always prepared , * I murmur . He looks at me confused as he redoes his fly. I hold up the empty packet . * A man can hope , Anastasia , dream even , and sometimes his dreams come true. * He sounds so odd , his eyes burning. I just don * t understand. My postcoital glow is fading fast. What is his problem ? * So , on your desk , that * s been a dream ? * I ask dryly , trying humor to lighten the atmosphere between us . He smiles an enigmatic smile that doesn * t reach his eyes , and I know immediately this is not the first time he * s had sex on his desk. The thought is unwelcome. I squirm uncomfortably as my postcoital glow evaporates . * I * d better go and have a shower. * I stand and start to move past him . He frowns and runs a hand through his hair . * I * ve got a couple more calls to make. I * ll join you for breakfast once you * re out of the shower. I think Mrs. Jones has laundered your clothes from yesterday. They * re in the closet. * What ? When the hell did she do that ? Jeez , could she hear us ? I flush . * Thank you , * I mutter . * You * re most welcome"
