"to my world. * We lie there , panting together , waiting for our breathing to slow. He gently strokes my hair. I * m on his chest again. But this time , I don * t have the strength to lift my hand and feel him. Boy * I survived. That wasn * t so bad. I * m more stoic than I thought. My inner goddess is prostrate * well , at least she * s quiet. Christian nuzzles my hair again , inhaling deeply . * Well done , baby , * he whispers , quiet joy in his voice. His words curl around me like a soft , fluffy towel from the Heathman Hotel , and I * m so pleased that he * s happy . He picks at the strap on my camisole . * Is this what you sleep in ? * he asks gently . * Yes , * I breathe sleepily . * You should be in silks and satins , you beautiful girl. I * ll take you shopping. * * I like my sweats , * I murmur , trying and failing to sound irritated . He kisses my head again . * We * ll see , * he says . We lie for a few more minutes , hours , who knows , and I think I doze . * I have to go , * he says , and leaning down , he kisses my forehead gently. * Are you okay ? * His voice is soft .

They chafe a little against my still-smarting behind. I * m so confused by my reaction. I remember him saying * I can * t remember when * that I would feel so much better after a good hiding. How can that be so ? I really don * t get it. But strangely , I do. I can * t say that I enjoyed the experience. In fact , I would still go a long way to avoid it , but now * I have this safe , weird , bathed in afterglow , sated feeling. I put my head in my hands. I just don * t understand . Christian reenters the room. I can * t look him in the eye. I stare down at my hands . * I found some baby oil. Let me rub it into"
