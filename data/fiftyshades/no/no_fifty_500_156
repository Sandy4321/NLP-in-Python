"My heart tightens painfully. This is the reality . * He came here to fuck me , that * s all. * * Who said romance was dead ? * she whispers , horrified. I * ve shocked Kate. I didn * t think that was possible. I shrug apologetically . * He uses sex as a weapon. * * Fuck you into submission ? * She shakes her head disapprovingly. I blink rapidly at her , and I feel the blush as it spreads across my face. Oh * spot on , Katherine Kavanagh , Pulitzer Prize * winning journalist . * Ana , I don * t understand , you just let him make love to you ? * * No , Kate , we don * t make love * we fuck * Christian * s terminology. He doesn * t do the love thing. * * I knew there was something weird about him. He has commitment issues. * I nod , as if in agreement. Inwardly , I pine. Oh , Kate * I wish I could tell you everything , everything about this strange , sad , kinky guy , and you could tell me to forget about him. Stop me from being a fool . * I guess it * s all a little overwhelming , * I murmur. That * s the understatement of the year . Because I don * t want to talk about Christian anymore , I ask her about Elliot. Katherine * s whole demeanor changes at the mere mention of his name. She lights up from within , beaming at me . * He * s coming over early Saturday to help load up. * She hugs the hairbrush * boy , has she got it bad * and I feel a familiar faint stab of envy. Kate has found herself a normal man , and she looks so happy . I turn and hug her . * Oh , I meant to say. Your dad called while you were * er , occupied. Apparently Bob has sustained some injury , so your mom and he can * t make graduation. But your dad will be here Thursday. He wants you to call. * * Oh * my mom never called me. Is Bob okay ? * * Yes. Call her in the morning. It * s late now. * * Thanks , Kate. I * m okay now. I * ll call Ray in the morning , too. I think I * ll just turn in. * She smiles , but her eyes crinkle at the corners with concern . After she * s gone , I sit and read the contract again , making more notes as I go. When I * ve finished , I fire up the laptop , ready to respond . There * s an e-mail from Christian in my inbox . From : Christian Grey Subject : This Evening Date"
