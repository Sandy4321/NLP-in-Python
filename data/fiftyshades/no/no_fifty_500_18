"at me . Heart failure . * Miss Steele. What a pleasant surprise. * His gaze is unwavering and intense . Holy crap. What the hell is he doing here , looking all outdoorsy with his tousled hair and in his cream chunky-knit sweater , jeans , and walking boots ? I think my mouth has popped open , and I can * t locate my brain or my voice . * Mr. Grey , * I whisper , because that * s all I can manage. There * s a ghost of a smile on his lips and his eyes are alight with humor , as if he * s enjoying some private joke . * I was in the area , * he says by way of explanation. * I need to stock up on a few things. It * s a pleasure to see you again , Miss Steele. * His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel * or something . I shake my head to gather my wits. My heart is pounding at a frantic tempo , and for some reason I * m blushing furiously under his steady scrutiny. I am utterly thrown by the sight of him standing before me. My memories of him did not do him justice. He * s not merely good-looking * he * s the epitome of male beauty , breathtaking , and he * s here. Here in Clayton * s Hardware Store. Go figure. Finally my cognitive functions are restored and reconnected with the rest of my body . * Ana. My name * s Ana , * I mutter. * What can I help you with , Mr. Grey ? * He smiles , and again it * s like he * s privy to some big secret. It is so disconcerting. Taking a deep breath , I put on my professional I * ve-worked-in-this-shop-for-years fa * ade. I can do this . * There are a few items I need. To start with , I * d like some cable ties , * he murmurs , his expression both cool and amused . Cable ties ? * We stock various lengths. Shall I show you ? * I mutter , my voice soft and wavering. Get a grip , Steele . A slight frown mars Grey * s rather lovely brow. * Please. Lead the way , Miss Steele , * he says. I try for nonchalance as I come out from behind the counter , but really I * m concentrating hard on not falling over my own feet * my legs are suddenly the consistency of Jell-O. I * m so glad I decided to wear my best jeans this morning . * They * re with the electrical goods , aisle eight. * My voice is a little too bright. I glance up at him and regret it almost immediately. Damn , he * s handsome ."
