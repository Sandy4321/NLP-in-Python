"Grey is followed into the suite by a man in his mid-thirties , all buzz cut and stubble in a sharp dark suit and tie who stands silently in the corner. His hazel eyes watch us impassively . * Miss Steele , we meet again. * Grey extends his hand , and I shake it , blinking rapidly. Oh my * he really is quite * As I touch his hand , I * m aware of that delicious current running right through me , lighting me up , making me blush , and I * m sure my erratic breathing must be audible . * Mr. Grey , this is Katherine Kavanagh , * I mutter , waving a hand toward Kate , who comes forward , looking him squarely in the eye . * The tenacious Miss Kavanagh.
