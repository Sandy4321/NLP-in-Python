"* He pauses , struggling to find the words I think. * Incompatibility. * He shrugs . * And you think that I might be compatible with you ? * * Yes. * * So you * re not seeing any of them anymore ? * * No , Anastasia , I * m not. I am monogamous in my relationships. * Oh * this is news . * I see. * * Do the research , Anastasia. * I put my knife and fork down. I can not eat any more . * That * s it ? That * s all you * re going to eat ? * I nod. He scowls at me but chooses not to say anything. I breathe a small sigh of relief. My stomach is churning with all this new information , and I * m feeling a little lightheaded from the wine. I watch as he devours everything on his plate. He eats like a horse. He must work out to stay in such great shape. The memory of the way his pajamas hung from his hips comes unbidden to my mind. The image is totally distracting. I squirm uncomfortably. He glances up at me , and I blush . * I * d give anything to know what you * re thinking right at this moment , * he murmurs. I blush further . He smiles a wicked smile at me . * I can guess , * he teases softly . * I * m glad you can * t read my mind. * * Your mind , no , Anastasia , but your body * that I * ve gotten to know quite well since yesterday. * His voice is suggestive. How does he switch so quickly from one mood to the next ? He * s so mercurial * It * s hard to keep up . He motions for the waitress and asks for the check. Once he * s paid , he stands and holds out his hand . * Come. * Taking my hand in his , he leads me back to the car. This contact , flesh to flesh , it * s what is so unexpected from him , normal , intimate. I can * t reconcile this ordinary , tender gesture with what he wants to do in that room * the Red Room of Pain . We are quiet on the drive from Olympia to Vancouver , both lost in our own thoughts. When he parks outside my apartment , it * s five in the evening. The lights are on * Kate is at home. Packing , no doubt , unless Elliot is still there. He switches off the engine , and I realize I * m going to have to leave him . * Do you want to come in ? * I ask. I don * t want him to go. I want to prolong our time"
