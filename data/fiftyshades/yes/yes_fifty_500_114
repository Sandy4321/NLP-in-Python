", and I can no longer deny it. I let go , losing all cogent thought as my orgasm seizes me , wringing my insides again and again. Holy fuck. I cry out , and the world dips and disappears from view as the force of my climax renders everything null and void . I am panting and vaguely hear the rip of foil.
