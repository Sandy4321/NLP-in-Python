"astride me again . * Are you thirsty , Anastasia ? * he asks , his voice teasing * Yes , * I breathe , because my mouth is suddenly parched. I hear the ice clink against the glass , and he leans down and kisses me , pouring a delicious , crisp liquid into my mouth as he does. It * s white wine. It * s so unexpected , so hot , though it * s chilled and Christian * s lips are cool . * More ? * he whispers . I nod. It tastes all the more divine because it * s been in his mouth. He leans down , and I drink another mouthful from his lips * oh my . * Let * s not go too far ; we know your capacity for alcohol is limited , Anastasia. * I can * t help it. I grin , and he leans down to deliver another delicious mouthful. He shifts so he * s lying beside me , his erection at my hip. Oh , I want him inside me . * Is this nice ? * he asks , but I hear the edge in his voice . I tense. He moves the glass again and leans down , kissing me and depositing a small shard of ice in my mouth with a little wine. He slowly and leisurely trails chilled kisses down the center of my body , from the base of my throat to between my breasts , down my torso to my belly. He pops a fragment of ice in my navel in a pool of cool , cold wine. It burns all the way down to the depths of my belly. Wow . * Now you have to keep still , * he whispers. * If you move , Anastasia , you * ll get wine all over the bed. * My hips flex automatically . * Oh no. If you spill the wine , I will punish you , Miss Steele. * I groan and desperately fight the urge to tilt my hips , pulling on my restraint. Oh no * please . With one finger , he pulls down my bra cups in turn , my breasts pushed up , exposed and vulnerable. Leaning down , he kisses and tugs at each of my nipples in turn with cool , cold lips. I fight my body as it tries to arch in response . * How nice is this ? * he breathes , blowing on one of my nipples . I hear another clink of ice , and then I can feel it around my right nipple as he tugs the left one with his lips. I moan , struggling not to move. It * s sweet , agonizing torture . * If you spill the wine , I won * t let you come. * * Oh * please * Christian * Sir * Please."
