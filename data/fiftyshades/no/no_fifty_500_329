"slip them on , and he grins at me. Hmm , another piece of Christian Grey * s underwear * a trophy to add to my collection * along with the car , the BlackBerry , the Mac , his black jacket , and a set of valuable old first editions. I shake my head at his largesse , and I frown as a scene from Tess crosses my mind : the strawberry scene. It evokes my dream. To hell with Dr. Flynn * Freud would have a field day * and then he * d probably die trying to deal with Fifty Shades . * I * ll give you some room now that you * re up. * Christian exits toward the living area , and I wander into the bathroom. I have needs to attend to , and I want a quick wash. Seven minutes later , I am in the living area , scrubbed , brushed , and dressed in jeans , my camisole , and Christian Grey * s underwear. Christian glances up from the small dining table where he * s eating breakfast. Breakfast ! Jeez , at this time . * Eat , * he says . Holy crap * my dream. I gape at him , thinking about his tongue on his palate. Hmm , his expert tongue . * Anastasia , * he says sternly , pulling me out of my reverie . It really is too early for me. How to handle this ? * I * ll have some tea. Can I take a croissant for later ? * He eyes me suspiciously , and I smile very sweetly . * Don * t rain on my parade , Anastasia , * he warns softly . * I will eat later when my stomach * s woken up. About seven thirty a.m. * okay ? * * Okay. * He peers down at me . Honestly. I have to concentrate hard on not making a face at him . * I want to roll my eyes at you. * * By all means , do , and you will make my day , * he says sternly . I gaze up at the ceiling . * Well , a spanking would wake me up , I suppose. * I purse my lips in quiet contemplation . Christian * s mouth drops open . * On the other hand , I don * t want you to be all hot and bothered ; the climate here is warm enough. * I shrug nonchalantly . Christian closes his mouth and tries very hard to look displeased , but fails hopelessly. I can see the humor lurking in the back of his eyes . * You are , as ever , challenging , Miss Steele. Drink your tea. * I notice the Twinings label , and inside , my heart sings. See , he does care , my subconscious mouths at me."
