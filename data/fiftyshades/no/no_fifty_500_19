"* After you , * he murmurs , gesturing with his long-fingered , beautifully manicured hand . With my heart almost strangling me * because it * s in my throat trying to escape from my mouth * I head down one of the aisles to the electrical section. Why is he in Portland ? Why is he here at Clayton * s ? And from a very tiny , underused part of my brain * probably located at the base of my medulla oblongata near where my subconscious dwells * comes the thought : He * s here to see you. No way ! I dismiss it immediately. Why would this beautiful , powerful , urbane man want to see me ? The idea is preposterous , and I kick it out of my head . * Are you in Portland on business ? * I ask , and my voice is too high , like I * ve got my finger trapped in a door or something. Damn !

He bends and selects a packet . * These will do , * he says with his oh-so-secret smile . * Is there anything else ? * * I * d like some masking tape. * Masking tape ? * Are you redecorating ? * The words are out before I can stop them. Surely he hires laborers or has staff to help him decorate ? * No , not redecorating , * he says quickly , then smirks , and I have the uncanny feeling that he * s laughing at me . Am I that funny ? Funny looking ? * This way , * I murmur , embarrassed. * Masking tape is in the decorating aisle. * I glance behind me as he follows . * Have you worked here long ? * His voice is low , and he * s gazing at me , concentrating hard. I blush brightly. Why the hell does he have this effect on me ? I feel like I * m fourteen"
