", * he says . * I will. Thanks for coming , Dad. * * Wouldn * t have missed it for the world , Annie. You make me so proud. * Oh no. I * m not going to get emotional. A huge lump forms in my throat , and I hug him , hard. He puts his arms around me , bemused , and I can * t help it * tears pool in my eyes . * Hey , Annie , sweetheart , * Ray croons. * Big old day * eh ? Want me to come in and make you some tea ? * I laugh , in spite of my tears. Tea is always the answer , according to Ray. I remember my mother complaining about him , saying that when it came to tea and sympathy , he was always good at the tea , not so hot on the sympathy . * No , Dad , I * m good. It * s been so great to see you. I * ll visit real soon once I * m settled in Seattle. * * Good luck with the interviews. Let me know how they go. * * Sure thing , Dad. * * Love you , Annie. * * Love you , too , Dad. * He smiles , his brown eyes warm , glowing , and he climbs back into his car. I wave him off as he drives into the dusk , and I wander listlessly back into the apartment . First thing I do is check my cell phone. It needs recharging , so I have to hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can collect my messages. Four missed calls , one voice message , and two texts. Three missed calls from Christian * no messages. One missed call from Jos * and a voice mail from him wishing me all the best for graduation . I open the texts . * Are you home safe ? * * Call me * They are both from Christian. Why didn * t he call the house ? I head into my bedroom and fire up the mean machine .

Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . Jeez * why is he so worried about my Beetle ? It has given me three years of loyal service , and Jos * has always been on hand to maintain it for me. Christian * s next e-mail is from today .
