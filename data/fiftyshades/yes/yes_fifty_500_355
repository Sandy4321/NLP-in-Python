Do you want to come with me ? * After what feels like a monumental amount of time , he slowly starts washing me again . * What time ? * * The opening is at seven thirty p.m. * He kisses my ear . * Okay. * Inside my subconscious relaxes and then collapses , slumped into an old battered armchair . * Were you nervous about asking me ? * * Yes. How can you tell ? * * Anastasia , your whole body * s just relaxed , * he says dryly . * Well , you just seem to be , um * on the jealous side. * * Yes , I am , * he says darkly. * And you * d do well to remember that.

I want you ready and waiting in my playroom in fifteen minutes. * He stands and gazes down at me . * You can get ready in your room. Incidentally , the walk-in closet is now full of clothes for you. I don * t want any arguments about them. * He narrows his eyes , daring me to say something. When I don * t , he stalks off to his study . Me ! Argue ? With you , Fifty Shades ? It * s more than my backside * s worth. I sit on the barstool ,"
