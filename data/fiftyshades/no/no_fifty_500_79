"out a potential lover is a complete freaky sadist or masochist ? Fear * yes * that seems to be the overriding feeling. I recognize it now. But weirdly not of him * I don * t think he * d hurt me , well , not without my consent. So many questions cloud my mind. Why ? How ? When ? How often ? Who ? I walk toward the bed and run my hands down one of the intricately carved posts. The post is very sturdy , the craftsmanship outstanding . * Say something , * Christian commands , his voice deceptively soft . * Do you do this to people or do they do it to you ? * His mouth quirks up , either amused or relieved . * People ? * He blinks a couple of times as he considers his answer. * I do this to women who want me to. * I don * t understand . * If you have willing volunteers , why am I here ? * * Because I want to do this with you , very much. * * Oh , * I gasp. Why ? I wander to the far corner of the room and pat the waist-high padded bench and run my fingers over the leather. He likes to hurt women. The thought depresses me . * You * re a sadist ? * * I * m a Dominant. * His eyes are a scorching gray , intense . * What does that mean ? * I whisper . * It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me , in all things. * I frown at him as I try to assimilate this idea . * Why would I do that ? * * To please me , * he whispers as he cocks his head to one side , and I see a ghost of a smile . Please him ! He wants me to please him ! I think my mouth drops open. Please Christian Grey. And I realize , in that moment , that yes , that * s exactly what I want to do. I want him to be damned delighted with me. It * s a revelation . * In very simple terms , I want you to want to please me , * he says softly. His voice is hypnotic . * How do I do that ? * My mouth is dry , and I wish I had more wine. Okay , I understand the pleasing bit , but I am puzzled by the soft-boudoir Elizabethan-torture setup. Do I want to know the answer ? * I have rules , and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction , I shall reward you. If you don * t , I shall punish you , and you will learn"
