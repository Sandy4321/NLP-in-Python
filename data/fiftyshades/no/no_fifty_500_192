"Did you try the wine at the reception ? * Christian makes a face . * Yes. It was foul. * * I thought of you when I tasted it. How did you get to be so knowledgeable about wine ? * * I * m not knowledgeable , Anastasia , I just know what I like. * His eyes shine , almost silver , and it makes me flush. * Some more ? * he asks , referring to the champagne . * Please. * Christian rises gracefully and collects the bottle. He fills my cup. Is he getting me tipsy ? I eye him suspiciously . * This place looks pretty bare. Are you ready for the move ? * * More or less. * * Are you working tomorrow ? * * Yes , my last day at Clayton * s. * * I * d help you move , but I promised to meet my sister at the airport. * Oh * this is news . * Mia arrives from Paris very early Saturday morning. I * m heading back to Seattle tomorrow , but I hear Elliot is giving you two a hand. * * Yes , Kate is very excited about that. * Christian frowns. * Yes , Kate and Elliot , who would have thought ? * he murmurs , and for some reason he doesn * t look pleased. * So what are you doing about work in Seattle ? * When are we going to talk about the limits ? What * s his game ? * I have a couple of interviews for intern places. * * You were going tell me this when ? * He arches a brow . * Er * I * m telling you now. * He narrows his eyes . * Where ? * For some reason , possibly because he might use his influence , I don * t want to tell him . * A couple of publishing houses. * * Is that what you want to do , something in publishing ? * I nod warily . * Well ? * He looks at me patiently wanting more information . * Well what ? * * Don * t be obtuse , Anastasia , which publishing houses ? * he scolds . * Just small ones , * I murmur . * Why don * t you want me to know ? * * Undue influence. * He frowns . * Oh , now you * re being obtuse. * He laughs. * Obtuse ? Me ? God , you * re challenging. Drink up , let * s talk about these limits. * He fishes out another copy of my e-mail and the list. Does he wander about with these lists in his pockets ? I think there * s one in his jacket that I have. Shit , I * d better not forget that. I drain my cup"
