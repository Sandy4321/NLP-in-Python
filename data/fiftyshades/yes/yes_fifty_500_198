"I soften toward the car , feeling guilty about my fit of pique. His intentions are good , misguided , but not from a bad place . * I * m happy for you to loan this to me , like the laptop. * He sighs heavily. * Okay. On loan. Indefinitely. * He looks warily at me . * No , not indefinitely , but for now. Thank you. * He frowns. I reach up and kiss him on his cheek . * Thank you for the car , sir , * I say as sweetly as I can manage . He grabs me suddenly and yanks me up against him , one hand at my back holding me to him and the other fisting in my hair . * You are one challenging woman , Ana Steele. * He kisses me passionately , forcing my lips apart with his tongue , taking no prisoners . My blood heats immediately , and I * m returning his kiss with my own passion. I want him badly * in spite of the car , the books , the soft limits * the caning * I want him . * It * s taking all my self-control not to fuck you on the hood of this car right now , just to show you that you are mine , and if I want to buy you a fucking car , I * ll buy you a fucking car , * he growls. * Now let * s get you inside and naked. * He plants a swift rough kiss on me . Boy , he * s angry. He grabs my hand and leads me back into the apartment and straight into my bedroom * no passing go. My subconscious is behind the sofa again , head hidden under her hands. He switches on the sidelight and halts , staring at me . * Please don * t be angry with me , * I whisper . His gaze is impassive ; his eyes cold shards of smoky glass . * I * m sorry about the car and the books * * I trail off. He remains silent and brooding. * You scare me when you * re angry , * I breathe , staring at him . He closes his eyes and shakes his head. When he opens them , his expression has softened. He takes a deep breath and swallows . * Turn around , * he whispers. * I want to get you out of that dress. * Another mercurial mood swing ; it * s so hard to keep up. Obediently , I turn , and my heart is thumping , desire instantly replacing unease , coursing through my blood and settling dark and yearning , low , low in my belly. He scoops my hair off my back so it hangs down my right side , curling at my breast. He places his index finger"
