", my limits * safely * oh , please ! I scoff angrily. Serve and obey in all things. All things ! I shake my head in disbelief. Actually , don * t the marriage vows use those words * obey ? This throws me. Do couples still say that ? Only three months * is that why there have been so many ? He doesn * t keep them for long ? Or have they had enough after three months ? Every weekend ? That * s too much. I * ll never see Kate or whatever friends I may make at my new job , provided I get one. Perhaps I should have one weekend a month to myself. Perhaps when I have my period * that sounds * practical. He * s my master ! I * m to be dealt with as he pleases ! Holy shit . I shudder at the thought of being flogged or whipped.

He won * t loan me to another Dominant * damn right he won * t. That would be totally unacceptable. Why am I even thinking about this ? I can * t look him in the eye. How weird is that ? The only way I ever have any chance to see what he * s thinking. Actually , who am I kidding ? I never know what he * s thinking , but I like looking into his eyes. He has beautiful eyes * captivating , intelligent , deep , and dark , dark with dominant secrets. I recall his burning smoky gaze and press my thighs together , squirming . And I can * t touch him. Well , no surprise there. And these silly rules * No , no , I can * t do this. I put my head in my hands. This is no way to have a relationship. I need some sleep. I * m shattered. All the physical shenanigans I * ve been engaged in over the last twenty-four hours have been , frankly , exhausting. And mentally * oh , man , this is so much to handle. As Jos * would say , a real mind-fuck. Perhaps in the morning this might not read like a bad joke . I scramble up and change quickly. Perhaps I should borrow Kate * s pink flannel pajamas. I want something cuddly and reassuring around me. I head to the bathroom in my T-shirt and sleep shorts and brush my teeth . I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror. You can * t seriously be considering this * My subconscious sounds sane and rational , not her usual snarky self. My inner goddess is jumping"
