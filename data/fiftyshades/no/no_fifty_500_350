"acquired wheelie case for the clothes my mother has bought me. * This way , ma * am. * I sigh. He * s so polite. I remember , though I would like to erase it from my memory , that this man has bought me underwear. In fact * and the thought unsettles me * he * s the only man who * s ever bought me underwear. Even Ray * s never had to endure that hardship. We walk in silence to the black Audi SUV outside in the airport parking lot , and he holds the door open for me. I clamber in , wondering if wearing such a short skirt for the return to Seattle was a good idea. It was cool and welcome in Georgia. Here I feel exposed. Once Taylor has stowed my bags in the trunk , we set off for Escala . The journey is slow , caught up in rush-hour traffic. Taylor keeps his eyes on the road ahead. Taciturn does not begin to describe him . I can bear the silence no longer . * How * s Christian , Taylor ? * * Mr. Grey is preoccupied , Miss Steele. * Oh , this must be * the situation. * I am mining a seam of gold . * Preoccupied ? * * Yes , ma * am. * I frown at Taylor , and he glances at me in the rearview mirror , our eyes meeting. He * s saying no more. Jeez , he can be as tight lipped as the control freak himself . * Is he okay ? * * I believe so , ma * am. * * Are you more comfortable calling me Miss Steele ? * * Yes , ma * am. * * Oh , okay. * Well , that curtails our conversation , and we continue in silence. I begin to think that Taylor * s recent slip , when he told me that Christian had been hell on wheels , was an anomaly. Perhaps he * s embarrassed about it , worried that he * s been disloyal. The silence is suffocating . * Could you put some music on , please ? * * Certainly , ma * am. What would you like to hear ? * * Something soothing. * I see a smile play on Taylor * s lips as our eyes meet briefly again in the mirror . * Yes , ma * am. * He pushes a few buttons on the steering wheel , and the gentle strains of Pachelbel * s Canon fills the space between us. Oh yes * this is what I need . * Thank you. * I sit back as we drive slowly but steadily along Interstate 5 into Seattle . TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER HE drops me outside the impressive fa * ade that is the entrance to Escala . * In you go , ma * am ,"
