"there , Ana , * he whispers in my ear. * Another margarita ? * * Jos * Luis Rodriguez * are you trying to get me drunk ? Because I think it * s working. * I giggle. * I think I * d better have a beer. I * ll go get us a pitcher. * * More drink , Ana ! * Kate bellows . Kate has the constitution of an ox. She * s got her arm draped over Levi , one of our fellow English students and her usual photographer on the student newspaper. He * s given up taking photos of the drunkenness that surrounds him. He only has eyes for Kate. She * s all tiny camisole , tight jeans , and high heels , hair piled high with tendrils hanging down softly around her face , her usual stunning self. Me , I * m more of a Converse and T-shirt kind of girl , but I * m wearing my most flattering jeans. I move out of Jos * * s hold and get up from our table . Whoa. Head spin . I have to grab the back of the chair. Tequila-based cocktails are not a good idea . I make my way to the bar and decide that I should visit the bathroom while I am on my feet. Good thinking , Ana. I stagger off through the crowd. Of course , there * s a line , but at least it * s quiet and cool in the corridor. I reach for my cell phone to relieve the boredom of waiting. Hmm * Who did I last call ? Was it Jos * ? Before that , a number I don * t recognize. Oh yes. Grey , I think this is his number. I giggle. I have no idea what the time is ; maybe I * ll wake him. Perhaps he can tell me why he sent me those books and the cryptic message. If he wants me to stay away , he should leave me alone. I suppress a drunken grin and hit the * call * button. He answers on the second ring . * Anastasia ? * He * s surprised to hear from me. Well , frankly , I * m surprised to be calling him. Then my befuddled brain registers * how does he know it * s me ? * Why did you send me the books ? * I slur at him . * Anastasia , are you okay ? You sound strange. * His voice is filled with concern . * I * m not the strange one , you are. * There * that told him , my courage fuelled by alcohol . * Anastasia , have you been drinking ? * * What * s it to you ? * * I * m * curious. Where are you ? * * In a bar. *"
