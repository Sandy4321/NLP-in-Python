It * s getting better. * * Good. * She turns her attention back to the four cookbooks she has open on the kitchen table . * Mom * if you like , I * ll cook this evening. * * Oh , honey , that * s kind of you , but I want to do it. * * Okay. * I grimace , knowing full well that my mother * s cooking is pretty hit or miss. Perhaps she * s improved since she moved to Savannah with Bob. There was a time I wouldn * t subject anyone to her cooking * even * who do I hate ? Oh yes * Mrs. Robinson * Elena. Well , maybe her.
