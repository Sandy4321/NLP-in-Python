"Is it legal ? Stalker , my subconscious whispers at me through the cloud of tequila that * s still floating in my brain , but somehow , because it * s him , I don * t mind . * Do you have a jacket or a purse ? * * Er * yes , I came with both. Christian , please , I need to tell Kate. She * ll worry. * His mouth presses into a hard line , and he sighs heavily . * If you must. * He sets me down and , taking my hand , leads me back into the bar. I feel weak , still drunk , embarrassed , exhausted , mortified , and , on some strange level , absolutely off-the-charts thrilled. He * s clutching my hand * such a confusing array of emotions. I * ll need at least a week to process them all . It * s noisy , crowded , and the music has started so there is a large crowd on the dance floor. Kate is not at our table , and Jos * has disappeared. Levi looks lost and forlorn on his own . * Where * s Kate ? * I shout at Levi above the noise. My head is beginning to pound in time to the thumping bass line of the music . * Dancing , * Levi shouts , and I can tell he * s mad. He * s eyeing Christian suspiciously. I struggle into my black jacket and place my small shoulder bag over my head so it sits at my hip. I * m ready to go , once I * ve seen Kate . I touch Christian * s arm and lean up and shout in his ear , * She * s on the dance floor , * brushing his hair with my nose , smelling his clean , fresh smell. All those forbidden , unfamiliar feelings that I have tried to deny surface and run amok through my drained body. I flush , and somewhere deep , deep down my muscles clench deliciously . He rolls his eyes at me and takes my hand again and leads me to the bar. He * s served immediately , no waiting for Mr. Control Freak Grey. Does everything come so easily to him ? I can * t hear what he orders. He hands me a very large glass of iced water . * Drink. * He shouts his order at me . The moving lights are twisting and turning in time to the music , casting strange colored light and shadows all over the bar and the clientele. He * s alternately green , blue , white , and a demonic red. He * s watching me intently. I take a tentative sip . * All of it , * he shouts . He * s so overbearing. He runs his hand through his unruly hair."
