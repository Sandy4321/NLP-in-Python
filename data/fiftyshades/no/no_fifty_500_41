"great pictures. * Do I need a visual reminder of the beautiful Christian I-Don * t-Want-You Grey ? * Sure. * I magic a smile on my face and stroll over to the laptop. And there he is , staring at me in black and white , staring at me and finding me lacking . I pretend to read the article , all the time meeting his steady gray gaze , searching the photo for some clue as to why he * s not the man for me * his own words to me. And it * s suddenly blindingly obvious. He * s too gloriously good-looking. We are poles apart and from two very different worlds. I have a vision of myself as Icarus flying too close to the sun and crashing and burning as a result. His words make sense. He * s not the man for me. This is what he meant , and it makes his rejection easier to accept * almost. I can live with this. I understand . * Very good , Kate , * I manage. * I * m going to study. * I am not going to think about him again for now , I vow to myself , and opening my course notes , I start to read .

I keep coming back to the I don * t do the girlfriend thing quote , and I * m angry that I didn * t pounce on this information sooner , before I was in his arms mentally begging him with every fiber of my being to kiss me. He * d said it there and then. He didn * t want me as a girlfriend. I turn onto my side. Idly , I wonder if perhaps he * s celibate. I close my eyes and begin to drift. Maybe he * s saving himself. Well , not for you. My sleepy subconscious has a final swipe at me before unleashing itself on my dreams . And that night , I dream of gray eyes and leafy patterns in milk , and I * m running through dark places with eerie strip lighting , and I don * t know if I * m running toward something or away from it * it * s just not clear . I put my pen down. Finished. My final exam is over. A Cheshire cat grin spreads over my face. It * s probably the first time all week that I * ve smiled. It * s Friday , and we shall be celebrating tonight , really celebrating. I might even get drunk ! I * ve never been drunk before. I glance across the hall at Kate , and she * s still scribbling furiously , five minutes to the finish. This is it ,"
