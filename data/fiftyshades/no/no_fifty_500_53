", my company does not invest or manufacture any kind of surveillance devices. And third , if I hadn * t come to get you , you * d probably be waking up in the photographer * s bed , and from what I can remember , you weren * t overly enthused about him pressing his suit , * he says acidly . Pressing his suit ! I glance up at Christian. He * s glaring at me , eyes blazing , aggrieved. I try to bite my lip , but I fail to repress my giggle . * Which medieval chronicle did you escape from ? You sound like a courtly knight. * His mood visibly shifts. His eyes soften and his expression warms , and there * s a trace of a smile on his lips . * Anastasia , I don * t think so. Dark knight , maybe. * His smile is sardonic , and he shakes his head. * Did you eat last night ? * His tone is accusatory. I shake my head. What major transgression have I committed now ?

You didn * t eat , you got drunk , you put yourself at risk. * He closes his eyes , dread etched briefly on his face , and he shudders.

Though maybe part of me would like to be. The thought pierces through the irritation I feel at his high-handed words. I flush at the waywardness of my subconscious * she * s doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his . * I would have been fine. I was with Kate. * * And the photographer ? * he snaps at me . Hmm * young Jos * . I * ll need to face him at some point . * Jos * just got out of line. * I shrug . * Well , the next time"
