", but I have promised to text her when I arrive in Seattle. I haven * t told her about the helicopter ; she * d freak . I also have the Jos * issue. He * s left three messages and seven missed calls on my cell. He * s also called home twice. Kate has been very vague as to where I am. He * ll know she * s covering for me. Kate doesn * t do vague. But I have decided to let him stew. I * m still too angry with him . Christian mentioned some kind of written paperwork , and I don * t know if he was joking or if I * m going to have to sign something. It * s frustrating trying to guess. And on top of all the angst , I can barely contain my excitement or my nerves. Tonight * s the night ! After all this time , am I ready for this ? My inner goddess glares at me , tapping her small foot impatiently. She * s been ready for this for years , and she * s ready for anything with Christian Grey , but I still don * t understand what he sees in me * mousey Ana Steele * it makes no sense . He is punctual , of course , and waiting for me when I leave Clayton * s. He climbs out of the back of the Audi to open the door and smiles warmly at me . * Good evening , Miss Steele , * he says . * Mr. Grey. * I nod politely to him as I climb into the backseat of the car. Taylor is sitting in the driver * s seat . * Hello , Taylor , * I say . * Good evening , Miss Steele. * His voice is polite and professional. Christian climbs in the other side and clasps my hand , giving it a gentle squeeze that echoes through my body . * How was work ? * he asks . * Very long , * I reply , and my voice is husky , too low , and full of need . * Yes , it * s been a long day for me , too. * * What did you do ? * I manage . * I went hiking with Elliot. * His thumb strokes my knuckles , back and forth , and my heart skips a beat as my breathing accelerates. How does he do this to me ? He * s only touching a very small area of my body , and the hormones are flying . The drive to the heliport is short and , before I know it , we arrive. I wonder where the fabled helicopter might be. We * re in a built-up area of the city , and even I know helicopters need space to take off and land. Taylor"
