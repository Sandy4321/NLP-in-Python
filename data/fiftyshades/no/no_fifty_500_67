"beautiful , sexy , funny , forward * all the things that I * m not. But her answering grin is infectious . * And I * m seeing him again this evening. * She claps her hands and jumps up and down like a small child. She can not contain her excitement and happiness , and I can * t help but feel happy for her. A happy Kate * this is going to be interesting . * Christian is taking me to Seattle this evening. * * Seattle ? * * Yes. * * Maybe you will then ? * * Oh , I hope so. * * You like him , then ? * * Yes. * * Like him enough to * ? * * Yes. * She raises her eyebrows . * Wow. Ana Steele , finally falling for a man , and it * s Christian Grey * hot , sexy billionaire. * * Oh yeah * it * s all about the money. * I smirk , and we both fall into a fit of giggles . * Is that a new blouse ? * she asks , and I let her have all the unexciting details about my night . * Has he kissed you yet ? * she asks as she makes coffee . I blush . * Once. * * Once ! * she scoffs . I nod , rather shamefaced. * He * s very reserved. * She frowns. * That * s odd. * * I don * t think odd covers it , really. * * We need to make sure you * re simply irresistible for this evening , * she says with determination . Oh no * this sounds like it will be time consuming , humiliating , and painful . * I have to be at work in an hour. * * I can work with that time frame. Come on. * Kate grabs my hand and takes me into her bedroom . THE DAY DRAGS AT Clayton * s even though we * re busy. We * ve hit the summer season , so I have to spend two hours restocking the shelves once the shop is closed. It * s mindless work , and it gives me too much time to think. I * ve not really had a chance all day . Under Kate * s tireless and frankly intrusive instruction , my legs and underarms are shaved to perfection , my eyebrows plucked , and I am buffed all over. It has been a most unpleasant experience. But she assures me that this is what men expect these days. What else will he expect ? I have to convince Kate that this is what I want to do. For some strange reason , she doesn * t trust him , maybe because he * s so stiff and formal. She says she can * t put her finger on it"
