"me , crippling me with a dark and tantalizing desire. I glance quickly around the subtly lit room : the cross , the table , the couch , the bench * that bed. It looms so large , and it * s made up with red satin sheets. Which piece of apparatus will he use ? The door opens and Christian breezes in , ignoring me completely. I glance down quickly , staring at my hands , positioned with care on my spread thighs. Placing something on the large chest beside the door , he strolls casually toward the bed. I indulge myself in a quick glimpse at him , and my heart almost lurches to a stop. He * s naked except for those soft ripped jeans , top button casually undone. Jeez , he looks so freaking hot. My subconscious is frantically fanning herself , and my inner goddess is swaying and writhing to some primal carnal rhythm. She * s so ready. I lick my lips instinctively. My blood pounds through my body , thick and heavy with salacious hunger. What is he going to do to me ? Turning , he nonchalantly walks back to the chest of drawers. Opening one , he begins to remove items and place them on the top. My curiosity burns , blazes even , but I resist the overwhelming temptation to sneak a quick peek. When he finishes what he * s doing , he comes to stand in front of me. I can see his naked feet , and I want to kiss every inch of them * run my tongue over his instep , suck each of his toes. Holy shit . * You look lovely , * he breathes . I keep my head down , conscious that he * s staring at me while I am practically naked. I feel the flush as it slowly spreads over my face. He bends down and cups my chin , forcing my face up to meet his gaze . * You are one beautiful woman , Anastasia. And you * re all mine , * he murmurs. * Stand up. * His command is soft , full of sensual promise . Shakily , I get to my feet . * Look at me , * he breathes , and I stare up into his smoldering gaze. It is his Dom gaze * cold , hard , and sexy as hell , seven shades of sin in one enticing look. My mouth dries , and I know I will do anything he asks. An almost cruel smile plays across his lips . * We don * t have a signed contract , Anastasia. But we * ve discussed limits. And I want to reiterate we have safewords , okay ? * Holy fuck * what has he got planned that I need safewords ? * What are they ? * he asks authoritatively . I frown slightly at his question"
