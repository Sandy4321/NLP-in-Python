"This is a man in need. His fear is naked and obvious , but he * s lost * somewhere in his darkness. His eyes are wide and bleak and tortured. I can soothe him , join him briefly in the darkness and bring him into the light . * Show me , * I whisper . * Show you ? * * Show me how much it can hurt. * * What ? * * Punish me. I want to know how bad it can get. * Christian steps back away from me , completely confused . * You would try ? * * Yes. I said I would. * But I have an ulterior motive. If I do this for him , maybe he will let me touch him . He blinks. * Ana , you * re so confusing. * * I * m confused , too. I * m trying to work this out.

He opens the door and , still grasping my arm , grabs what looks like a belt from the rack beside the door , then leads me over to the red leather bench in the far corner of the room . * Bend over the bench , * he murmurs softly . Okay. I can do this. I bend over the smooth soft leather. He * s left my bathrobe on. In a quiet part of my brain , I * m vaguely surprised that he hasn * t made me take it off. Holy fuck , this is going to hurt * I know . * We * re here because you said yes , Anastasia. And you ran from me. I am going to hit you six times , and you will count with me. * Why the hell doesn * t he just get on with it ? He always makes such"
