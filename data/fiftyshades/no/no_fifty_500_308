"down , he kisses my cheek , taking me by surprise . * Christian , this is my mother , Carla. * My ingrained manners take over . He turns to greet my mom. * Mrs. Adams , I am delighted to meet you. * How does he know her name ? He gives her the heart-stopping , Christian Grey * patented , full-blown , no-prisoners smile. She doesn * t have a hope. My mother * s lower jaw practically hits the table. Jeez , get a grip , Mom. She takes his proffered hand , and they shake. My mother hasn * t replied. Oh , complete dumbfounded speechlessness is genetic * I had no idea . * Christian , * she manages finally , breathlessly . He smiles knowingly at her , his gray eyes twinkling. I narrow my eyes at them both . * What are you doing here ? * My question sounds more brittle than I mean , and his smile disappears , his expression now guarded. I am thrilled to see him but completely thrown off balance , my anger about Mrs. Robinson simmering through my veins. I don * t know if I want to shout at him or throw myself into his arms * but I don * t think he * d like either * and I want to know how long he has been watching us. I * m also a little anxious about the e-mail I just sent him . * I came to see you , of course. * He gazes down at me impassively. Oh , what is he thinking ? * I * m staying in this hotel. * * You * re staying here ? * I sound like a sophomore on amphetamines , too high pitched even for my own ears . * Well , yesterday you said you wished I was here. * He pauses , trying to gauge my reaction. * We aim to please , Miss Steele. * His voice is quiet with no trace of humor . Crap * is he mad ? Maybe the Mrs. Robinson comments ? Or the fact that I am on my third , soon to be fourth , Cosmo ? My mother is glancing anxiously at the two of us . * Won * t you join us for a drink , Christian ? * She waves to the waiter , who is at her side in a nanosecond . * I * ll have a gin and tonic , * Christian says. * Hendricks if you have it , or Bombay Sapphire. Cucumber with the Hendricks , lime with the Bombay. * Holy hell * only Christian could make a meal out of ordering a drink . * And two more Cosmos , please , * I add , looking anxiously at Christian. I am drinking with my mother * no way can he be angry about that . * Please pull"
