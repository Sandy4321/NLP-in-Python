"said spring into my mind . I don * t want to lose you * You * ve bewitched me * You * ve completely beguiled me * I * ll miss you , too * more than you know * I gaze at my mom. She is on her fourth marriage. Maybe she does know something about men after all . * Most men are moody , darling , some more than others. Take your father , for instance * * Her eyes soften and sadden whenever she thinks of my dad. My real dad , this mythical man I never knew , snatched so cruelly from us in a combat training accident when he was a marine. Part of me thinks my mom has been looking for someone like my dad all this time * maybe she * s finally found what she * s looking for in Bob. Pity she couldn * t find it with Ray . * I used to think your father was moody. But now when I look back , I just think he was too caught up in his job and trying to make a life for us. * She sighs. * He was so young , we both were. Maybe that was the issue. * Hmm * Christian is not exactly old. I smile fondly at her. She can become very soulful thinking about my father , but I * m sure he had nothing on Christian * s moods . * Bob wants to take us out tonight for dinner. To his golf club. * * Oh no ! Bob * s started playing golf ? * I scoff in disbelief . * Tell me about it , * groans my mother , rolling her eyes . AFTER A LIGHT LUNCH back at the house , I start to unpack. I am going to treat myself to a siesta. My mother has disappeared to mold some candles or whatever she does with them , and Bob is at work , so I have time to catch up on some sleep. I open the Mac and fire it up. It * s two in the afternoon in Georgia , eleven in the morning in Seattle. I wonder if I have a reply from Christian. Nervously , I open up my e-mail . From : Christian Grey Subject : Finally ! Date : May 31 2011 07 : 30 To : Anastasia Steele Anastasia , I am annoyed that as soon as you put some distance between us , you communicate openly and honestly with me. Why can * t you do that when we * re together ? Yes , I * m rich. Get used to it. Why shouldn * t I spend money on you ? We * ve told your father I * m your boyfriend , for heaven * s sake. Isn * t that what boyfriends do ? As your Dom , I would expect you"
