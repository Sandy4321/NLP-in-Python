", am I , Miss Steele ? * I jump awake , and Christian is standing in front of me , his arms crossed , glaring down at me. Oh , shit , caught napping * this is not going to be good. His eyes soften as I gaze up at him . * Stand up , * he orders . I climb warily to my feet. He stares at me and his mouth quirks up . * You * re shattered , aren * t you ? * I nod shyly , flushing . * Stamina , Miss Steele. * He narrows his eyes at me. * I haven * t had my fill of you yet. Hold out your hands in front as if you * re praying. * I blink at him. Praying ! Praying for you to go easy on me. I do as I * m told. He takes a cable tie and fastens it around my wrists , tightening the plastic. Holy hell. My eyes fly to his . * Look familiar ? * he asks , unable to conceal his smile . Jeez * the plastic cable ties. Restocking at Clayton * s ! It all becomes clear. I gape up at him as adrenaline spikes though my body anew. Okay * that * s got my attention * I * m awake now . * I have scissors here. * He holds them up for me to see. * I can cut you out of this in a moment. * I try to pull my wrists apart , testing my bonds , and as I do , the plastic bites into my flesh. It * s sore , but if I relax my wrists they * re fine * the tie is not cutting into my skin . * Come. * He takes my hands and leads me over to the four-poster bed. I notice now that it has dark red sheets on it and a shackle at each corner . He leans down and whispers in my ear , * I want more * much , much more. * And my heartbeat starts pounding again. Oh boy . * But I * ll make this quick. You * re tired. Hold on to the post , * he says . I frown. Not on the bed then ? I find I can part my hands as I grasp the ornately carved wooden post . * Lower , * he orders. * Good. Don * t let go. If you do , I * ll spank you. Understand ? * * Yes , Sir. * * Good. * He stands behind me and grasps my hips , and then quickly lifts me backward so I * m bending forward , holding the post . * Don * t let go , Anastasia , * he warns. * I * m going to fuck you hard from behind.
