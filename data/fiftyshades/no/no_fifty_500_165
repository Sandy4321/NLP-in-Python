"enigmatically and climbs out of the booth , holding his hand out to me . * Bring your wine , * he murmurs . Placing my hand in his , I slide out and stand up beside him. He releases me , and his hand reaches for my elbow. He leads me back through the bar and up the grand stairs to a mezzanine floor. A young man in full Heathman livery approaches us . * Mr. Grey , this way , sir. * We follow him through a plush seating area to an intimate dining room. Just one secluded table. The room is small but sumptuous. Beneath a shimmering chandelier , the table is all starched linen , crystal glasses , silver cutlery , and white rose bouquet. An old-world , sophisticated charm pervades the wood-paneled room. The waiter pulls out my chair , and I sit. He places my napkin in my lap. Christian sits opposite me. I peek up at him . * Don * t bite your lip , * he whispers . I frown. Damn it. I don * t even know that I * m doing it . * I * ve ordered already. I hope you don * t mind. * Frankly , I * m relieved. I * m not sure I can make any further decisions . * No , that * s fine , * I acquiesce . * It * s good to know that you can be amenable. Now , where were we ? * * The nitty-gritty. * I take another large sip of wine. It really is delicious. Christian Grey does wine well. I remember the last sip of wine he gave me , in my bed. I blush at the intrusive thought . * Yes , your issues. * He fishes into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a piece of paper. My e-mail . * Clause 2. Agreed. This is for the benefit of us both. I shall redraft. * I blink at him. Holy shit * we are going to go through each of these points one at a time. I just don * t feel so brave face-to-face. He looks so earnest. I steel myself with another sip of my wine. Christian continues . * My sexual health. Well , all of my previous partners have had blood tests , and I have regular tests every six months for all the health risks you mention. All my recent tests are clear. I have never taken drugs. In fact , I * m vehemently antidrug. I have a strict no-tolerance policy with regards to drugs for all my employees , and I insist on random drug testing. * Wow * control freakery gone mad. I blink at him , shocked . * I have never had any blood transfusions. Does that answer your question ? * I nod , impassive . * Your next point I mentioned earlier. You can walk away"
