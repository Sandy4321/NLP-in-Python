"his forearms. I feel so full. He stays still , letting me acclimatize to the intrusive , overwhelming feeling of him inside me . * I * m going to move , baby , * he breathes after a moment , his voice tight . Oh . He eases back with exquisite slowness. And he closes his eyes and groans , and thrusts into me again. I cry out a second time , and he stills . * More ? * he whispers , his voice raw . * Yes , * I breathe. He does it once more , and stills again . I groan , my body accepting him * Oh , I want this . * Again ? * he breathes . * Yes. * It * s a plea . And he moves , but this time he doesn * t stop.

Leaning down , he gently presses a kiss against my forehead then slowly pulls out of me . * Ooh. * I wince at the unfamiliarity . * Did I hurt you ? * Christian asks as he lies down beside me propped on one"
