"to accept whatever I spend on you with no argument. Incidentally , tell your mother , too . I don * t know how to answer your comment about feeling like a whore. I know that * s not what you * ve written , but it * s what you imply. I don * t know what I can say or do to eradicate these feelings. I * d like you to have the best of everything. I work exceptionally hard so I can spend my money as I see fit. I could buy you your heart * s desire , Anastasia , and I want to. Call it redistribution of wealth , if you will. Or simply know that I would not , could not ever think of you in the way you described , and I * m angry that * s how you perceive yourself. For such a bright , witty , beautiful young woman , you have some real self-esteem issues , and I have half a mind to make an appointment for you with Dr. Flynn . I apologize for frightening you. I find the thought of instilling fear in you abhorrent. Do you really think I * d let you travel in the hold ? I offered you my private jet , for heaven * s sake. Yes , it was a joke , a poor one obviously. However , the fact is the thought of you bound and gagged turns me on ( this is not a joke * it * s true ) . I can lose the crate * crates do nothing for me. I know you have issues with gagging * we * ve talked about that * and if/when I do gag you , we * ll discuss it. What I think you fail to realize is that in Dom/sub relationships it is the sub who has all the power. That * s you. I * ll repeat this * you are the one with all the power. Not I. In the boathouse you said no. I can * t touch you if you say no * that * s why we have an agreement * what you will and won * t do. If we try things and you don * t like them , we can revise the agreement. It * s up to you * not me. And if you don * t want to be bound and gagged in a crate , then it won * t happen . I want to share my lifestyle with you. I have never wanted anything so much. Frankly , I * m in awe of you , that one so innocent would be willing to try. That says more to me than you could ever know. You fail to see I am caught in your spell , too , even though I have told you this countless times. I don * t want to lose you. I"
