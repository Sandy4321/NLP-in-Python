Ana x From : Christian Grey Subject : Exasperating Women Date : May 24 2011 18 : 59 To : Anastasia Steele You * re welcome . Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . I call Ray , who is just about to watch the Sounders play some soccer team from Salt Lake City , so our conversation is mercifully brief. He * s driving down on Thursday for graduation. He wants to take me out afterward for a meal. My heart swells talking to Ray , and a huge lump forms in my throat. He has been my constant through all Mom * s romantic ups and downs. We have a special bond that I treasure. Even though he * s my stepdad , he * s always treated me as his own , and I can * t wait to see him. It * s been too long. His quiet fortitude is what I need now , what I miss. Maybe I can channel my inner Ray for my meeting tomorrow . Kate and"
