"I sit and face him , drinking in his beauty. Will I ever get enough of this man ? AS WE LEAVE THE room , Christian throws a sweatshirt at me . * You * ll need this. * I look at him , puzzled . * Trust me. * He grins , leans over , and kisses me quickly on the lips , then grabs my hand and we head out . Outside , in the relative cool of the half light of predawn , the valet hands Christian a set of keys to a flashy sports car with a soft top. I raise an eyebrow at Christian , who smirks back at me . * You know , sometimes it * s great being me , * he says with a conspiratorial but smug grin that I simply can * t help emulating. He * s so lovable when he * s playful and carefree. He opens my car door with an exaggerated bow , and in I climb. He is in such a good mood . * Where are we going ? * * You * ll see. * He grins as he slips the car into drive , and we head out on Savannah Parkway. He programs the GPS and presses a switch on the steering wheel , and a classical orchestral piece fills the car . * What * s this ? * I ask as the sweet , sweet sound of a hundred violin strings assails us . * It * s from La Traviata. An opera by Verdi. * Oh , my * it * s lovely . * La Traviata ? I * ve heard of that. I can * t think where. What does it mean ? * Christian glances at me and smirks . * Well , literally , * the woman led astray. * It * s based on Alexandre Dumas * s book , La Dame aux Cam * lias. * * Ah. I * ve read it. * * I thought you might * ve. * * The doomed courtesan. * I squirm uncomfortably in the plush leather seat. Is he trying to tell me something ? * Hmm , it * s a depressing story , * I mutter . * Too depressing ? Do you want to choose some music ? This is on my iPod. * Christian has that secret smile again . I can * t see his iPod anywhere. He taps the screen on the console between us , and behold * there is a playlist . * You choose. * His lips twitch up into a smile , and I know it * s a challenge . Christian Grey * s iPod , this should be interesting. I scroll through the touch screen and find the perfect song. I press * play. * I wouldn * t have figured him for a Britney fan. The club-mix , techno beat assaults us"
