"m so pleased , I smile at him broadly. His lips part , like he * s taking a sharp intake of breath , and he blinks. For a fraction of a second , he looks lost somehow , and the Earth shifts slightly on its axis , the tectonic plates sliding into a new position . Oh my. Christian Grey * s lost look . * Let me know about tomorrow. * Reaching into his back pocket , he pulls out his wallet. * My card. It has my cell number on it. You * ll need to call before ten in the morning. * * Okay. * I grin up at him. Kate is going to be thrilled . * Ana ! * Paul has materialized at the other end of the aisle. He * s Mr. Clayton * s youngest brother. I * d heard he was home from Princeton , but I wasn * t expecting to see him today . * Er , excuse me for a moment , Mr. Grey. * Grey frowns as I turn away from him . Paul has always been a buddy , and in this strange moment that I * m having with the rich , powerful , awesomely off-the-charts attractive control freak Grey , it * s great to talk to someone who * s normal. Paul hugs me hard , taking me by surprise . * Ana , hi , it * s so good to see you ! * he gushes . * Hello , Paul , how are you ? You home for your brother * s birthday ? * * Yep. You * re looking well , Ana , really well. * He grins as he examines me at arm * s length. Then he releases me but keeps a possessive arm draped over my shoulder. I shuffle from foot to foot , embarrassed. It * s good to see Paul , but he * s always been overfamiliar . When I glance up at Christian Grey , he * s watching us like a hawk , his eyes hooded and speculative , his mouth a hard , impassive line. He * s changed from the weirdly attentive customer to someone else * someone cold and distant . * Paul , I * m with a customer. Someone you should meet , * I say , trying to defuse the antagonism I see in Grey * s expression. I drag Paul over to meet him , and they size each other up. The atmosphere is suddenly arctic . * Er , Paul , this is Christian Grey. Mr. Grey , this is Paul Clayton. His brother owns the place. * And for some irrational reason , I feel I have to explain a bit more . * I * ve known Paul ever since I * ve worked here , though we don * t see each other that often. He * s back"
