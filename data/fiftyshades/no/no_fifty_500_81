"Yes. * * Not with you. * * No. I told you , I don * t sleep with anyone , except you when you * re stupefied with drink. * His voice is reprimanding . My mouth presses in a hard line. This is what I can not reconcile. Kind , caring Christian , who rescues me from inebriation and holds me gently while I * m throwing up into the azaleas , and the monster who possesses whips and chains in a special room . * Where do you sleep ? * * My room is downstairs. Come , you must be hungry. * * Weirdly , I seem to have lost my appetite , * I murmur petulantly . * You must eat , Anastasia , * he scolds , and , taking my hand , leads me back downstairs . Back in the impossibly big room , I am filled with deep trepidation. I am on the edge of a precipice , and I have to decide whether to jump . * I * m fully aware that this is a dark path I * m leading you down , Anastasia , which is why I really want you to think about this. You must have some questions , * he says as he wanders into the kitchen area , releasing my hand . I do. But where to start ? * You * ve signed your NDA ; you can ask me anything you want and I * ll answer. * I stand at the breakfast bar watching him as he opens the refrigerator and pulls out a plate of different cheeses with two large bunches of green and red grapes. He sets the plate down on the worktop and proceeds to cut up a French baguette . * Sit. * He points to one of the stools at the breakfast bar , and I obey his command. If I * m going to do this , I * m going to have to get used to it. I realize he * s been this bossy since I met him . * You mentioned paperwork. * * Yes. * * What paperwork ? * * Well , apart from the NDA , a contract saying what we will and won * t do. I need to know your limits , and you need to know mine. This is consensual , Anastasia. * * And if I don * t want to do this ? * * That * s fine , * he says carefully . * But we won * t have any sort of relationship ? * I ask . * No. * * Why ? * * This is the only sort of relationship I * m interested in. * * Why ? * He shrugs. * It * s the way I am. * * How did you become this way ? * * Why is anyone the way they are"
