"* There. Now can you join me for coffee ? * Grey smiles as if it * s a done deal . I frown . * Um * Mr. Grey , er * this really * look , Taylor doesn * t have to drive them home. * I flash a brief look at Taylor , who remains stoically impassive. * I * ll swap vehicles with Kate , if you give me a moment. * Grey smiles a dazzling , unguarded , natural , all-teeth-showing , glorious smile. Oh my * He opens the door of the suite so I can go in. I scoot around him to reenter the room , finding Katherine in deep discussion with Jos * . * Ana , I think he definitely likes you , * she says with no preamble whatsoever. Jos * glares at me with disapproval. * But I don * t trust him , * she adds. I raise my hand up in the hope that she * ll stop talking. By some miracle , she does . * Kate , if you take Wanda , can I take your car ? * * Why ? * * Christian Grey has asked me to go for coffee with him. * Her mouth pops open. Speechless Kate ! I savor the moment. She grabs me by my arm and drags me into the bedroom that * s off the living area of the suite . * Ana , there * s something about him. * Her tone is full of warning. * He * s gorgeous , I agree , but I think he * s dangerous. Especially for someone like you. * * What do you mean , someone like me ? * I demand , affronted . * An innocent like you , Ana. You know what I mean , * she says a little irritated. I flush . * Kate , it * s just coffee. I * m starting my exams this week , and I need to study , so I won * t be long. * She purses her lips as if considering my request. Finally , she fishes her car keys out of her pocket and hands them to me. I hand her mine . * I * ll see you later. Don * t be long , or I * ll send out search and rescue. * * Thanks. * I hug her . I emerge from the suite to find Christian Grey waiting , leaning up against the wall , looking like a male model in a pose for some glossy high-end magazine . * Okay , let * s do coffee , * I murmur , flushing a beet red . He grins . * After you , Miss Steele. * He stands up straight , holding his hand out for me to go first. I make my way down the corridor , my knees shaky , my stomach full"
