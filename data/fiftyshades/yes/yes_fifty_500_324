"the floor. * I think we * ve done enough talking for now. * He clasps his hands on either side of my head and kisses me. Deeply. Possessing my mouth. Angling my head * controlling me. I moan against his lips. This is what he likes. This is what he * s so good at. Everything ignites inside me and my fingers are in his hair , holding him to me , and I * m kissing him back and saying I want you , too , the only way I know how. He groans , shifting me so I * m astride him , kneeling over him , his erection beneath me. He pulls back and looks at me , his eyes hooded , glowing and lustful. I drop my hands to grab on to the edge of the bath , but he grips both my wrists and pulls my hands behind my back , holding them together in one hand . * I * m going to have you now , * he whispers , and lifts me so that I * m hovering over him. * Ready ? * he breathes . * Yes , * I whisper , and he eases me on to him , slowly , exquisitely slowly * filling me * watching me as he takes me . I groan , closing my eyes , and I revel in the sensation , the stretching fullness. He flexes his hips , and I gasp , leaning forward , resting my forehead against his . * Please , let my hands go , * I whisper . * Don * t touch me , * he pleads , and releasing my wrists , he grabs my hips . Clasping the bath ledge , I move up and then down slowly , opening my eyes to gaze at him. He * s watching me , his mouth open , his breathing halted , stilted * his tongue between his teeth. He looks so * hot. We * re wet and slippery and moving against each other. I lean down and kiss him. He closes his eyes. Tentatively , I bring my hands up to his head and run my fingers through his hair , not taking my lips from his mouth. This is allowed. He likes this. I like this. And we move together. I tug his hair , tipping his head back and deepening the kiss , riding him * faster , picking up the rhythm. I moan against his mouth. He starts to lift me faster , faster * holding my hips. Kissing me back. We are wet mouths and tongues , tangled hair , and moving hips. All sensation * all consuming again. I am close * I am starting to recognize this delicious tightening * quickening. And the water * it * s swirling around us , our own whirlpool , a stirring vortex as our movements become more frantic *"
