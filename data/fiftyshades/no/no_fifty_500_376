"after a long while . I turn very slowly in his arms so I can face him. I am resting my head on his arm. His eyes are flinty gray and guarded . I gaze at his beautiful face. He * s giving nothing away , but he keeps his eyes on mine , hardly blinking. Oh , he is so breathtakingly good-looking. In such a short time , he * s become so , so dear to me. Reaching up , I caress his cheek and run the tips of my fingers through his stubble. He closes his eyes and exhales . * I * m sorry , * I whisper . He opens his eyes and looks at me puzzled . * What for ? * * What I said. * * You didn * t tell me anything I didn * t know. * And his eyes soften with relief. * I am sorry I hurt you. * I shrug. * I asked for it. * And now I know. I swallow. Here goes. I need to say my piece. * I don * t think I can be everything you want me to be , * I whisper. His eyes widen , and he blinks , his fearful expression returning . * You are everything I want you to be. * What ? * I don * t understand. I * m not obedient , and you can be as sure as hell I * m not going to let you do that to me again. And that * s what you need , you said so. * He closes his eyes again , and I can see myriad emotions cross his face. When he reopens them , his expression is bleak. Oh no . * You * re right. I should let you go. I am no good for you. * My scalp prickles as every single hair follicle on my body stands to attention , and the world falls away from me , leaving a wide , yawning abyss for me to fall into. Oh no . * I don * t want to go , * I whisper. Fuck * this is it. Pay or play. Tears swim in my eyes once more . * I don * t want you to go , either , * he whispers , his voice raw. He reaches up and gently strokes my cheek and wipes away a falling tear with his thumb. * I * ve come alive since I met you. * His thumb traces the contours of my lower lip . * Me , too , * I whisper. * I * ve fallen in love with you , Christian. * His eyes widen again , but this time with pure , undiluted fear . * No , * he breathes as if I * ve knocked the wind out of him . Oh no . * You can * t love me"
