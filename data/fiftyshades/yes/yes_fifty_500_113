"toe , the action resonating deep in my belly . * All good things , Miss Steele , * he breathes . This time he doesn * t stop at my knee , he continues up the inside of my thigh , pushing my thighs apart as he does. And I know what he * s going to do , and part of me wants to push him off because I * m mortified and embarrassed. He * s going to kiss me there ! I know it. And part of me is glorying in the anticipation. He turns to my other knee and kisses his way up my thigh , kissing , licking , sucking , and then he * s between my legs , running his nose up and down my sex , very softly , very gently. I writhe * oh my . He stops , waiting for me to calm. I do and raise my head to gaze at him , my mouth open as my pounding heart struggles to calm . * Do you know how intoxicating you smell , Miss Steele ? * he murmurs , and keeping his eyes on mine , he pushes his nose into my pubic hair and inhales . I flush scarlet everywhere , feeling faint , and I instantly close my eyes. I can * t watch him do that ! He blows gently up the length of my sex. Oh , fuck * * I like this. * He gently tugs at my pubic hair. * Perhaps we * ll keep this. * * Oh * please , * I beg . * Hmm , I like it when you beg me , Anastasia. * I groan . * Tit for tat is not my usual style , Miss Steele , * he whispers as he gently blows up and down me. * But you * ve pleased me today , and you should be rewarded. * I hear the wicked grin in his voice , and while my body is singing from his words , his tongue starts to slowly circle my clitoris as his hands hold down my thighs . * Aargh ! * I moan as my body bows and convulses at the touch of his tongue . He swirls his tongue around and around , again and again , keeping up the torture. I * m losing all sense of self , every atom of my being concentrating hard on that small , potent powerhouse at the apex of my thighs. My legs go rigid , and he slips his finger inside me , and I hear his growling groan . * Oh , baby. I love that you * re so wet for me. * He moves his finger in a wide circle , stretching me , pulling at me , his tongue mirroring his actions , around and around. I groan. It is too much * My body begs for relief"
