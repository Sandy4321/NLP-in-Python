"I will soon , * his voice is hoarse , raw , his breathing more disjointed . Fuck my mouth ! I moan , and I bite down on him. He gasps , and he pulls my hair tighter , painfully , so I release him . * Naughty , sweet girl , * he whispers , and then reaches over to the bedside table for a foil packet. * Stay still , don * t move , * he orders as he releases my hair .

My insides start quickening , and Christian picks up the rhythm . * You. Are. So. Sweet , * he murmurs between each thrust. * I. Want. You. So. Much. * I moan . * You. Are. Mine.
