"heart at the thought . Kate gazes at me with pursed lips and narrowed eyes , rather like my subconscious * all she needs are the half-moon specs . * You two need to sit down and talk to each other. * * We haven * t been doing much talking lately. * I blush. Other stuff. Nonverbal communication and that * s okay. Well , much more than okay . She grins. * That * ll be the sexing ! If that * s going well , then that * s half the battle , Ana. I * ll grab some Chinese takeout. Are you ready to go ? * * I will be. We don * t have to leave for a couple of hours or so. * * No * I * ll see you in twenty. * She grabs her jacket and leaves , forgetting to close the door. I shut it behind her and head off to my bedroom , mulling over her words . Is Christian afraid of his feelings for me ? Does he even have feelings for me ? He seems very keen , says I * m his * but that * s just part of his I-must-own-and-have-everything-now control freak Dominant self , surely. I realize that while I * m away , I will have to run through all our conversations again and see if I can pick out telltale signs . I * ll miss you , too * more than you know * You * ve completely beguiled me * I shake my head. I don * t want to think about it now. I am charging the BlackBerry , so I haven * t had it with me all afternoon. I approach it with caution , and I * m disappointed that there are no messages. I switch on the mean machine , and there are no messages there , either. Same e-mail address , Ana * my subconscious rolls her eyes at me , and for the first time I understand why Christian wants to spank me when I do that . Okay. Well , I * ll write him an e-mail .

Ana I sit and glare at the screen. Christian * s responses are usually instantaneous. I wait * and wait , and finally I hear the welcome ping from my inbox . From : Christian Grey Subject : My Day Date : May 30 2011 19 : 03 To : Anastasia Steele Dear Miss Steele , Everything you do interests me. You are the most fascinating woman I know .
