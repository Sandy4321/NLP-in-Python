"meekly. Stunned. He really wants this . In his bedroom , he stares down at me as we stand by his bed . * Trust me ? * he asks suddenly. I nod , wide-eyed with the sudden realization that I do trust him. What * s he going to do to me now ? An electric thrill hums through me . * Good girl , * he breathes , his thumb brushing my bottom lip. He steps away into his closet and comes back with a silver-gray silk woven tie . * Hold your hands together in front of you , * he orders as he peels the towel off me and throws it on the floor . I do as he asks , and he binds my wrists together with his tie , knotting it firmly. His eyes are bright with excitement. He tugs at the binding. It * s secure. Some Boy Scout he must have been to learn this knot. What now ? My pulse has gone through the roof , my heart beating a frantic rhythm.

I * m mesmerized by his tongue as it sweeps slowly over his upper lip. He * s staring into my eyes , watching me , appraising. He leans down and plants a chaste , swift kiss on my lips . * I * m going to kiss you all over , Miss Steele , * he says softly , and he cups my chin , pushing it up , giving him access to my throat. His lips glide down my throat , kissing , sucking , and nipping , to the small dip at the base of my neck. My body leaps to attention * everywhere. My recent bath experience has made my skin hypersensitive. My heated blood pools low in my belly , between my legs , right down there. I groan . I want to touch"
