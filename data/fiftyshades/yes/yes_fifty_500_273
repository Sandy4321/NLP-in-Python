", I can * t really feel them * but then again I know they * re there . He straightens my panties and leans forward , and his lips softly kiss my behind . * Stand up , * he orders , and shakily I get to my feet . Oh ! Now I can feel them * sort of. He grasps my hips to steady me while I reestablish my equilibrium . * You okay ? * he asks , his voice stern . * Yes. * * Turn around. * I turn and face him . The balls pull downward and involuntarily I clench around them. The feeling startles me but not in a bad way . * How does that feel ? * he asks . * Strange. * * Strange good or strange bad ? * * Strange good , * I confess , blushing . * Good. * There * s a trace of humor lurking in his eyes . * I want a glass of water. Go and fetch one for me please. * Oh . * And when you come back , I shall put you across my knee. Think about that , Anastasia. * Water ? He wants water * now * why ? As I leave the bedroom , it becomes abundantly clear why he wants me to walk around * as I do , the balls weigh down inside me , massaging me internally. It * s such a weird feeling and not entirely unpleasant. In fact , my breathing accelerates as I stretch up for a glass from the kitchen cabinet , and I gasp. Oh my * I may have to keep these. They make me needy , needy for sex . He * s watching me carefully when I return . * Thank you , * he says as he takes the glass from me . Slowly , he takes a sip , then places the glass on his bedside table. There * s a foil packet , ready and waiting , like me. And I know he * s doing this to build the anticipation. My heart has picked up a beat. He turns his bright gray gaze to mine . * Come. Stand beside me. Like last time. * I sidle up to him , my blood thrumming through my body , and this time * I * m excited. Aroused . * Ask me , * he says softly . I frown. Ask him what ? * Ask me , * his voice is slightly harder . What ? How was your water ? What does he want ? * Ask me , Anastasia. I won * t say it again. * And there * s such a threat implicit in his words , and it dawns on me. He wants me to ask him to spank me . Holy shit. He * s looking at me expectantly , his eyes growing colder."
