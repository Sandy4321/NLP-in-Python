"forgive Christian and his intervention. I open up my MacBook , hoping to test the theory that it works anywhere on the planet . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : Over-Extravagant Gestures Date : May 30 2011 21 : 53 To : Christian Grey Dear Mr. Grey , What really alarms me is how you knew which flight I was on . Your stalking knows no bounds. Let * s hope that Dr. Flynn is back from vacation . I have had a manicure , a back massage , and two glasses of champagne * a very nice start to my vacation . Thank you . Ana From : Christian Grey Subject : You * re Most Welcome Date : May 30 2011 21 : 59 To : Anastasia Steele Dear Miss Steele , Dr. Flynn is back , and I have an appointment this week . Who was massaging your back ? Christian Grey CEO with friends in the right places , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . Aha ! Payback time. Our flight has been called , so I shall e-mail him from the plane. It will be safer. I almost hug myself with mischievous glee . THERE IS SO MUCH room in first class. Champagne cocktail in hand , I settle myself into the sumptuous leather window seat as the cabin slowly fills. I call Ray to tell him where I am * a mercifully brief call , as it * s so late for him. * Love you , Dad , * I murmur . * You , too , Annie. Say hi to your mom. Good night. * * Good night. * I hang up . Ray is in good form. I stare at my Mac , and with the same childish glee building , I open my laptop and open up my e-mail . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : Strong Able Hands Date : May 30 2011 22 : 22 To : Christian Grey Dear Sir , A very pleasant young man massaged my back. Yes. Very pleasant indeed. I wouldn * t have encountered Jean-Paul in the ordinary departure lounge * so thank you again for that treat. I * m not sure if I * ll be allowed to e-mail once we take off , and I need my beauty sleep since I * ve not been sleeping so well recently . Pleasant dreams , Mr. Grey * thinking of you . Ana Oh , he * s going to flip out * and I shall be airborne and out of reach. Serves him right. If I * d been in the ordinary departure lounge , then Jean-Paul wouldn * t have gotten his hands on me. He was a very nice young man , in a blond , perma-tanned way * honestly , who has a tan in Seattle ? It * s just so wrong. I think he was gay * but I * ll just keep that detail"
