"shit. I hope I * m not that loud. I know Christian isn * t. I flush at the thought and escape to my room. After a brief not-at-all-awkward-thank-goodness hug , Jos * has gone. I don * t know when I * ll see him again , probably his photography show , and once again , I * m blown away that he finally has an exhibition. I shall miss him and his boyish charm. I couldn * t bring myself to tell him about the Beetle. I know he * ll freak when he finds out , and I can only deal with one man at a time freaking out at me. Once in my room , I check the mean machine , and of course , there * s an e-mail from Christian . From : Christian Grey Subject : Where Are You ? Date : May 27 2011 22 : 14 To : Anastasia Steele * I am at work. I will e-mail you when I get home. * Are you still at work or have you packed your phone , BlackBerry , and MacBook ? Call me , or I may be forced to call Elliot . Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . Crap * Jos * * shit . I grab my phone. Five missed calls and one voice message. Tentatively , I listen to the message. It * s Christian . * I think you need to learn to manage my expectations. I am not a patient man. If you say you are going to contact me when you finish work , then you should have the decency to do so. Otherwise , I worry , and it * s not an emotion I * m familiar with , and I don * t tolerate it very well. Call me. * Double crap. Will he ever give me a break ? I scowl at the phone. He is suffocating me. With a deep dread uncurling in my stomach , I scroll down to his number and press * call. * My heart is in my mouth as I wait for him to answer. He * d probably like to beat seven shades of shit out of me. The thought is depressing . * Hi , * he says softly , and his response knocks me off balance because I am expecting his anger , but if anything , he sounds relieved . * Hi , * I murmur . * I was worried about you. * * I know. I * m sorry I didn * t reply , but I * m fine. * He pauses for a beat . * Did you have a pleasant evening ? * He is crisply polite . * Yes. We finished packing and Kate and I had Chinese takeout with Jos * . * I close my eyes tightly as I say Jos * * s name. Christian says nothing ."
