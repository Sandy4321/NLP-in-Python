"liked , so I ordered a selection from the breakfast menu. * He gives me a crooked , apologetic smile . * That * s very profligate of you , * I murmur , bewildered by the choice , though I am hungry . * Yes , it is. * He sounds guilty . I opt for pancakes , maple syrup , scrambled eggs , and bacon. Christian tries to hide a smile as he returns to his egg white omelet. The food is delicious . * Tea ? * he asks . * Yes , please. * He passes me a small teapot of hot water and on the saucer is a Twinings English Breakfast teabag. Jeez , he remembers how I like my tea . * Your hair * s very damp , * he scolds . * I couldn * t find the hair dryer , * I mutter , embarrassed. Not that I looked . Christian * s mouth presses into a hard line , but he doesn * t say anything . * Thank you for the clothes. * * It * s a pleasure , Anastasia. That color suits you. * I blush and stare down at my fingers . * You know , you really should learn to take a compliment. * His tone is castigating . * I should give you some money for these clothes. * He glares at me as if I have offended him on some level. I hurry on . * You * ve already given me the books , which , of course , I can * t accept. But these clothes * please let me pay you back. * I smile tentatively at him . * Anastasia , trust me , I can afford it. * * That * s not the point. Why should you buy these for me ? * * Because I can. * His eyes flash with a wicked gleam . * Just because you can doesn * t mean that you should , * I reply quietly as he arches an eyebrow at me , his eyes twinkling , and suddenly I feel that we * re talking about something else , but I don * t know what it is. Which reminds me * * Why did you send me the books , Christian ? * My voice is soft. He puts down his cutlery and regards me intently , his eyes burning with some unfathomable emotion. Holy crap * my mouth dries . * Well , when you were nearly run over by the cyclist * and I was holding you and you were looking up at me * all * kiss me , kiss me , Christian * * * he pauses and shrugs * * I felt I owed you an apology and a warning. * He runs his hand through his hair. * Anastasia , I * m not a hearts and flowers kind of man"
