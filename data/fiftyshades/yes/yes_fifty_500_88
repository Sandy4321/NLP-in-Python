"he releases me and takes my hand and leads me through the apartment . His bedroom is vast. The ceiling-height windows look out on lit-up Seattle high-rises. The walls are white , and the furnishings are pale blue. The enormous bed is ultramodern , made of rough , gray wood like driftwood , four posts but no canopy. On the wall above it is a stunning painting of the sea . I am quaking like a leaf. This is it. Finally , after all this time , I * m going to do it , with none other than Christian Grey. My breath is shallow , and I can * t take my eyes off him. He removes his watch and places it on top of a chest of drawers that matches the bed , and removes his jacket , placing it on a chair. He * s dressed in his white linen shirt and jeans. He is heart-stoppingly beautiful. His dark copper hair is a mess , his shirt hanging out * his gray eyes bold and dazzling.

He places it on the chair . * Do you have any idea how much I want you , Ana Steele ? * he whispers. My breath hitches. I can not take my eyes off his. He reaches up and gently runs his fingers down my cheek to my chin . * Do you have any idea what I * m going to do to you ? * he adds , caressing my chin . The muscles inside the deepest , darkest part of me clench in the most delicious"
