"* * Ana ? Have you met someone ? * Wow * how does she do that ? The excitement in her voice is palpable . * No , Mom , it * s nothing. You * ll be the first to know if I do. * * Ana , you really need to get out more , honey. You worry me. * * Mom , I * m fine. How * s Bob ? * As ever , distraction is the best policy . Later that evening , I call Ray , my stepdad , Mom * s Husband Number Two , the man I consider my father and the man whose name I bear. It * s a brief conversation. In fact , it * s not so much a conversation as a one-sided series of grunts in response to my gentle coaxing. Ray is not a talker. But he * s still alive , he * s still watching soccer on TV ( and going bowling or fly-fishing , or making furniture , when he * s not ) . Ray is a skilled carpenter and the reason I know the difference between a hawk and a handsaw. All seems well with him . FRIDAY NIGHT , KATE AND I are debating what to do with our evening * we want some time off from our studies , from our work , and from student newspapers * when the doorbell rings. Standing on our doorstep is my good friend Jos * clutching a bottle of champagne . * Jos * ! Great to see you ! * I give him a quick hug. * Come in. * Jos * is the first person I met when I arrived at WSU , looking as lost and lonely as I did. We recognized a kindred spirit in each other that day , and we * ve been friends ever since. Not only do we share a sense of humor , but we also discovered that Ray and Jos * Senior were in the same army unit together. As a result , our fathers have become good friends , too . Jos * is studying engineering and is the first in his family to make it to college. He * s pretty damn bright , but his real passion is photography. Jos * has a great eye for a good picture . * I have news. * He grins , his dark eyes twinkling . * Don * t tell me * you * ve managed not to get kicked out for another week , * I tease , and he scowls playfully at me . * The Portland Place Gallery is going to exhibit my photos next month. * * That * s amazing * congratulations ! * Delighted for him , I hug him again. Kate beams at him , too . * Way to go , Jos * ! I should put this in the paper. Nothing"
