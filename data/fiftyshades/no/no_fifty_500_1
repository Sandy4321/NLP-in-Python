"made you some soup to heat up later. * I stare at her fondly. Only for you , Kate , would I do this . * I will. Good luck. And thanks , Ana * as usual , you * re my lifesaver. * Gathering my backpack , I smile wryly at her , then head out the door to the car. I can not believe I have let Kate talk me into this. But then Kate can talk anyone into anything. She * ll make an exceptional journalist. She * s articulate , strong , persuasive , argumentative , beautiful * and she * s my dearest , dearest friend . THE ROADS ARE CLEAR as I set off from Vancouver , Washington , toward Interstate 5. It * s early , and I don * t have to be in Seattle until two this afternoon.

I tuck one of the escaped tendrils of my hair behind my ear as I pretend she doesn * t intimidate me . * Miss Kavanagh is expected. Please sign in here , Miss Steele. You * ll want the last elevator on the right , press for the twentieth floor. * She smiles kindly at me , amused no doubt , as I sign in . She hands me a security pass that has * visitor * very firmly stamped on the front. I can * t help my smirk. Surely"
