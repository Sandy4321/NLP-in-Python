"* he says , holding the door open for me. * I * ll bring up your luggage. * His expression is soft , warm , avuncular even . Jeez * Uncle Taylor , what a thought . * Thank you for meeting me. * * It * s a pleasure , Miss Steele. * He smiles , and I head into the building. The doorman nods and waves . As I ride up to the thirtieth floor , a thousand butterflies stretch their wings and flutter erratically in my stomach. Why am I so nervous ? And I know it * s because I have no idea what kind of mood Christian * s going to be in when I arrive. My inner goddess is hopeful for one type of mood ; my subconscious , like me , is fraught with nerves . The elevator doors open , and I * m in the foyer. It is so strange not to be met by Taylor. Of course , he * s parking the car. In the great room , Christian is on his BlackBerry , talking quietly as he stares through the glass doors at the early evening Seattle skyline.

I stand paralyzed as he closes the distance between us , devouring me with his eyes. Holy shit * something * s amiss * the strain in his jaw , the anxiety around his eyes. He shrugs out of his jacket , undoes his dark tie , and slings them both onto the couch en route to me. Then his arms are wrapped around me , and he * s pulling me to him , hard , fast , gripping my ponytail to tilt my head up , kissing me like his life depends on it. What the hell ? He drags the hair tie painfully out of my hair , but I don * t care. There * s a desperate , primal quality to his kiss. He needs me , for whatever reason , at this point in time , and I have never felt so desired and coveted. It * s dark and sensual and alarming all at the same"
