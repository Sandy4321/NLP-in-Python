"have to go. I * ll think about a visit. Thank you. * * Honey , please , don * t let a man get under your skin. You * re far too young. Go and enjoy yourself. * * Yes , Mom , love you. * * Oh , Ana , I love you , too , so much. Stay safe , honey. * I hang up and face Kate , who glares at me . * Has that obscenely rich fucker upset you again ? * * No * sort of * er * yes. * * Just tell him to take a hike , Ana. You * ve been so up and down since you met him. I * ve never seen you like this. * The world of Katherine Kavanagh is very clear , very black and white. Not the intangible , mysterious , vague hues of gray that color my world. Welcome to my world . * Sit , let * s talk. Let * s have some wine. Oh , you * ve had champagne. * She spies the bottle. * Some good stuff , too. * I smile ineffectually , looking apprehensively at the couch. I approach it with caution. Hmm * sitting . * Are you okay ? * * I fell over and landed on my behind. * She doesn * t think to question my explanation , because I am one of the most uncoordinated people in Washington State. I never thought I * d see that as a blessing. I sit down gingerly , pleasantly surprised that I * m okay , and turn my attention to Kate but my mind glazes over and I * m pulled back to the Heathman * Well , if you were mine you wouldn * t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday. He said it then , and all I could concentrate on at the time was being his. All the warning signs were there , I was just too clueless and too enamored to notice . Kate comes back into the living area with a bottle of red wine and washed teacups . * Here we go. * She hands me a cup of wine. It won * t taste as good as the Bolly . * Ana , if he * s a jerk with commitment issues , dump him. Though I don * t really understand his commitment issues. He couldn * t take his eyes off you in the marquee , watched you like a hawk. I * d say he was completely smitten , but maybe he has a funny way of showing it. * Smitten ? Christian ? Funny way of showing it ? I * ll say . * Kate , it * s complicated. How was your evening ? * I ask . I can * t talk this through with Kate without revealing too much"
