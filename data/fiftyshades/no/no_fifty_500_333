"s mentioned it before . * We * re going to chase the dawn , Anastasia. * He turns and grins at me as the GPS urges him to turn right into what looks like an industrial complex. He pulls up outside a large white building with a sign reading BRUNSWICK SOARING ASSOCIATION . Gliding ! We * re going gliding ? He switches off the engine . * You up for this ? * he asks . * You * re flying ? * * Yes. * * Yes , please ! * I don * t hesitate. He grins and leans forward and kisses me . * Another first , Miss Steele , * he says as he climbs out of the car . First ? What sort of first ? First time flying a glider * shit ! No * he said that he * s done it before. I relax. He walks around and opens my door. The sky has turned to a subtle opal , shimmering and glowing softly behind the sporadic childlike clouds. Dawn is upon us . Taking my hand , Christian leads me around the building to a large stretch of tarmac where several planes are parked. Waiting beside them is a man with a shaved head and a wild look in his eye , accompanied by Taylor . Taylor ! Does Christian go anywhere without that man ? I beam at him , and he smiles kindly back at me . * Mr. Grey , this is your tow pilot , Mr. Mark Benson , * says Taylor. Christian and Benson shake hands and strike up a conversation that sounds very technical about wind speed , directions , and the like . * Hello , Taylor , * I murmur shyly . * Miss Steele. * He nods a greeting at me , and I frown. * Ana , * he corrects himself. * He * s been hell on wheels the last few days. Glad we * re here , * he says conspiratorially . Oh , this is news. Why ? Surely not because of me ! Revelation Thursday ! Must be something in the Savannah water that makes these men loosen up a bit . * Anastasia , * Christian summons me. * Come. * He holds out his hand . * See you later. * I smile at Taylor , and giving me a quick salute , he heads back to the parking lot . * Mr. Benson , this is my girlfriend , Anastasia Steele. * * Pleased to meet you , * I murmur as we shake hands . Benson gives me a dazzling smile . * Likewise , * he says , and I can tell from his accent that he * s British . As I take Christian * s hand , there * s a mounting excitement in my belly. Wow * gliding ! We follow Mark Benson out across the tarmac"
