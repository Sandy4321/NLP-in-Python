"s staring at me with pursed lips , tapping her foot. So you * ve just slept with him , given him your virginity , a man who doesn * t love you. In fact , he has very odd ideas about you , wants to make you some sort of kinky sex slave . ARE YOU CRAZY ? She * s shouting at me . I wince as I look in the mirror. I am going to have to process all this. Honestly , fancy falling for a man who * s beyond beautiful , richer than Croesus , and has a Red Room of Pain waiting for me. I shudder. I * m bewildered and confused. My hair is its usual wayward self. Just-fucked hair doesn * t suit me. I try to bring order to the chaos with my fingers but fail miserably and give up * maybe I * ll find hair ties in my purse . I * m starving. I head back out to the bedroom. Sleeping beauty is still sleeping , so I leave him and head for the kitchen . Oh no * Kate. I left my purse in Christian * s study. I fetch it and reach for my cell phone. Three texts . * RU OK Ana * * Where RU Ana * * Damn it Ana * I call Kate. When she doesn * t answer , I leave her a groveling message to tell her I am alive and have not succumbed to Bluebeard , well , not in the sense she would be worried about * or perhaps I have. Oh , this is so confusing. I have to try to categorize and analyze my feelings for Christian Grey. It * s an impossible task. I shake my head in defeat. I need alone time , away from here to think . I find two welcome hair ties at the same time in my bag and quickly tie my hair in pigtails. Yes ! The more girly I look perhaps the safer I * ll be from Bluebeard. I take my iPod out of the bag and plug my headphones in. There * s nothing like music to cook by. I slip it into the breast pocket of Christian * s shirt , turn it up loud , and start dancing . Holy hell , I * m hungry . I am daunted by his kitchen. It * s so sleek and modern , and none of the cupboards has handles. It takes me a few seconds to deduce that I have to push the cupboard doors to open them. Perhaps I should cook Christian breakfast. He was eating an omelet the other day * um , yesterday at the Heathman. Jeez , so much has happened since then. I check in the fridge , where there are plenty of eggs , and decide I want pancakes and bacon. I set about making some batter , dancing"
