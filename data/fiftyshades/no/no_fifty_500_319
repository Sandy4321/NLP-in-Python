He stands , holds his hand out for me , and hauls me to my feet . * Don * t look at me like that. * His voice is colder and scolding as he lets go of my hand . I flush , chastened , and stare down at my fingers , and I know , I know that someone stubbed cigarettes out on Christian. I feel sick . * Did she do that ? * I whisper before I can stop myself .
