"waiting for him to strike. His breathing is harsh , but then he * s just carried me across the lawn and up a flight of stairs. Gray eyes blaze with anger , need , and pure unadulterated lust . Holy shit. I could spontaneously combust from his look alone . * Please don * t hit me , * I whisper , pleading . His brow furrows , his eyes widening. He blinks twice . * I don * t want you to spank me , not here , not now. Please don * t. * His mouth drops open in surprise , and beyond brave , I tentatively reach up and run my fingers down his cheek , along the edge of his sideburn , to the stubble on his chin. It * s a curious mixture of soft and prickly. Slowly closing his eyes , he leans his face into my touch , and his breath hitches in his throat. Reaching up with my other hand , I run my fingers into his hair. I love his hair. His soft moan is barely audible , and when he opens his eyes , his look is wary , like he doesn * t understand what I * m doing . Stepping forward so I am flush against him , I pull gently on his hair , bringing his mouth down to mine , and I kiss him , forcing my tongue between his lips and into his mouth. He groans , and his arms embrace me , pulling me to him. His hands find their way into my hair , and he kisses me back , hard and possessive. His tongue and my tongue twist and turn together , consuming each other. He tastes divine . He pulls back suddenly , our collective breathing ragged and mingling. My hands drop to his arms , and he glares down at me . * What are you doing to me ? * he whispers , confused . * Kissing you. * * You said no. * * What ? * No to what ? * At the dinner table , with your legs. * Oh * that * s what this is all about . * But we were at your parents * dining table. * I stare up at him , completely bewildered . * No one * s ever said no to me before. And it * s so * hot. * His eyes widen , filled with wonder and lust. It * s a heady mix. I swallow instinctively. His hand moves down to my behind. He pulls me sharply against him , against his erection . Oh my * * You * re mad and turned on because I said no ? * I breathe , astonished . * I * m mad because you never mentioned Georgia to me. I * m mad because you went drinking with that guy who tried to seduce you"
