": Anastasia Steele Laters , baby . P.S. : I work for a living , too . Christian Grey CEO , Grey Enterprises Holdings , Inc . I shut the computer down , grinning like an idiot. How can I resist playful Christian ? I am going to be late for work. Well , it is my last week * Mr. and Mrs. Clayton will probably cut me some slack. I race into the shower , unable to shake my face-splitting grin. He e-mailed me. I * m like a small , giddy child. And all the contract angst fades. As I wash my hair , I try to think of what I could possibly ask him via e-mail. Surely it * s better to talk these things through. Suppose someone hacked into his account ? I flush at the thought. I dress quickly , shout a hasty good-bye to Kate , and I * m off to work my last week at Clayton * s . JOS * PHONES AT ELEVEN . * Hey , are we doing coffee ? * He sounds like the old Jos * . Jos * my friend , not a * what did Christian call him ? Suitor. Ugh . * Sure. I * m at work. Can you make it here for , say , twelve ? * * See you then. * He hangs up , and I go back to restocking the paintbrushes and thinking about Christian Grey and his contract . Jos * is punctual. He comes bounding into the shop like a gamboling dark-eyed puppy . * Ana. * He smiles his dazzling toothy all-Hispanic-American smile , and I can * t be angry with him anymore . * Hi , Jos * . * I hug him. * I * m starving. I * ll just let Mrs. Clayton know I * m going for lunch. * As we stroll to the local coffee shop , I slip my arm through Jos * * s. I * m so grateful for his * normality. Someone I know and understand . * Hey , Ana , * he murmurs. * You * ve really forgiven me ? * * Jos * , you know I can never stay mad at you for long. * He grins . I CAN * T WAIT TO get home , the lure of e-mailing Christian , and maybe I can begin my research project. Kate is out somewhere , so I fire up the new laptop and open my e-mail. Sure enough , there * s a message from Christian sitting in the inbox. I * m practically bouncing out of my seat with glee .
