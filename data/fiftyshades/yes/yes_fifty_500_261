"when you were drunk and who left you when you were ill with an almost complete stranger. What kind of friend does that ? And I * m mad and aroused because you closed your legs on me. * His eyes glitter dangerously , and he * s slowly inching up the hem of my dress . * I want you , and I want you now. And if you * re not going to let me spank you * which you deserve * I * m going to fuck you on the couch this minute , quickly , for my pleasure , not yours. * My dress is now barely covering my naked behind.

Holy crap * how do I stop ? With one swift thrust , he * s fully inside me. I groan loudly , gutturally , and revel in the fullness of his possession. He puts his hands on mine on top of my head , his elbows hold my arms out and down , and his legs"
