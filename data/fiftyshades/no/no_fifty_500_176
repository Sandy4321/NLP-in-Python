"my wrists and my ankles. He swirls the tip around my navel then continues to trail the leather tip south , through my pubic hair to my clitoris. He flicks the crop and it hits my sweet spot with a sharp slap , and I come , gloriously , shouting my release . Abruptly , I wake , gasping for breath , covered in sweat and feeling the aftershocks of my orgasm. Holy hell. I * m completely disorientated. What the hell just happened ? I * m in my bedroom alone. How ? Why ? I sit bolt upright , shocked * wow. It * s morning. I glance at my alarm clock * eight o * clock. I put my head in my hands. I didn * t know I could dream sex. Was it something I ate ? Perhaps the oysters and my Internet research manifesting itself in my first wet dream. It * s bewildering. I had no idea that I could orgasm in my sleep . Kate is skipping around the kitchen when I stagger in . * Ana , are you okay ? You look odd. Is that Christian * s jacket you * re wearing ? * * I * m fine. * Damn , should have checked in the mirror. I avoid her piercing green eyes. I * m still reeling from my morning * s event. * Yes , this is Christian * s jacket. * She frowns. * Did you sleep ? * * Not very well. * I head for the kettle. I need tea . * How was dinner ? * So it begins . * We had oysters. Followed by cod , so I * d say it was fishy. * * Ugh * I hate oysters , and I don * t want to know about the food. How was Christian ? What did you talk about ? * * He was attentive. * I pause. What can I say ? His HIV status is clear , he * s heavily into role-play , wants me to obey his every command , he hurt someone he tied to his playroom ceiling , and he wanted to fuck me in the private dining room. Would that be a good summary ? I try desperately to remember something from my encounter with Christian that I can discuss with Kate . * He doesn * t approve of Wanda. * * Who does , Ana ? That * s old news. Why are you being so coy ? Give it up , girlfriend. * * Oh , Kate , we talked about lots things. You know * how fussy he is about food. Incidentally , he liked your dress. * The kettle has boiled , so I make myself some tea. * Do you want tea ? Would you like me to hear your speech for today ? * * Yes , please. I worked on it last night"
