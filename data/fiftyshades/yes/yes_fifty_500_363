"I can not escape * I am completely at the mercy of his expert touch . He moves down to my belly * his tongue circling my navel * following the path of the flogger and the fur * I moan. He * s kissing and sucking and nibbling * moving south * and then his tongue is there. At the junction of my thighs. I throw my head back and cry out as I almost detonate into orgasm * I * m on the brink , and he stops . No ! The bed shifts , and he kneels between my legs. He leans toward the bedpost , and the cuff on my ankle is suddenly gone. I pull my leg to the middle of the bed * resting it against him. He leans over to the opposite post and frees my other leg. His hands travel quickly down both my legs , squeezing and kneading , bringing life back into them. Then , grasping my hips , he lifts me so that my back is no longer on the bed. I am arched , resting on my shoulders. What ? He * s kneeling up between my legs * and in one swift , slamming move he * s inside me * oh , fuck * and I cry out again. The quiver of my impending orgasm begins , and he stills. The quiver dies * oh no * he * s going to torture me further . * Please ! * I wail . He grips me harder * in warning ? I don * t know , his fingers digging into the flesh of my behind as I lay panting * so I purposefully still. Very slowly , he starts to move again * out and then in * agonizingly slowly. Holy fuck * please ! I * m screaming inside * And as the number of voices in the choral piece increases , so does his pace , infinitesimally , he * s so controlled * so in time with the music. And I can no longer bear it . * Please , * I beg , and in one swift move , he lowers me back onto the bed , and he * s lying on top of me , his hands on the bed beside my breasts as he supports his weight , and he thrusts into me. As the music reaches its climax , I fall * free-fall * into the most intense , agonizing orgasm I have ever had , and Christian follows me * thrusting hard into me three more times * finally stilling , then collapsing on top of me . As my consciousness returns from wherever it * s been , Christian pulls out of me. The music has stopped , and I can feel him stretch across my body as he undoes the cuff on my right wrist. I groan as my hand is freed. He quickly"
