"with surprise * I very rarely have hissy fits * and I briefly relent. * I just find him * intimidating , that * s all. * * Heathman , that figures , * mutters Kate. * I * ll give the manager a call and negotiate a space for the shoot. * * I * ll make supper. Then I need to study. * I can not hide my irritation with her as I open one of the cupboards to make supper . I AM RESTLESS THAT night , tossing and turning , dreaming of smoky gray eyes , coveralls , long legs , long fingers , and dark , dark unexplored places. I wake twice in the night , my heart pounding. Oh , I * m going to look just great tomorrow with so little sleep , I scold myself. I punch my pillow and try to settle . THE HEATHMAN IS NESTLED in the heart of downtown Portland. Its impressive brown stone edifice was completed just in time for the crash of the late 1920s. Jos * , Travis , and I are traveling in my Beetle , and Kate is in her CLK , since we can * t all fit in my car. Travis is Jos * * s friend and gopher , here to help out with the lighting. Kate has managed to acquire the use of a room at the Heathman free of charge for the morning in exchange for a credit in the article. When she explains at reception that we * re here to photograph Christian Grey , CEO , we are instantly upgraded to a suite. Just a regular-sized suite , however , as apparently Mr. Grey is already occupying the largest one in the building. An over-keen marketing executive shows us up to the suite * he * s terribly young and very nervous for some reason. I suspect Kate * s beauty and commanding manner disarm him , because he * s putty in her hands. The rooms are elegant , understated , and opulently furnished . It * s nine. We have half an hour to set up. Kate is in full flow . * Jos * , I think we * ll shoot against that wall , do you agree ? * She doesn * t wait for his reply. * Travis , clear the chairs. Ana , could you ask housekeeping to bring up some refreshments ? And let Grey know where we are. * Yes , mistress. She is so domineering. I roll my eyes but do as I * m told . Half an hour later , Christian Grey walks into our suite . Holy crap ! He * s wearing a white shirt , open at the collar , and gray flannel pants that hang from his hips. His unruly hair is still damp from a shower. My mouth goes dry looking at him * he * s so freaking hot."
