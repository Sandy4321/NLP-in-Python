"s there , the charge building between us. The amused look disappears from his face and his expression clouds , his eyes dark * oh my . The elevator doors open on the ground floor. Christian shakes his head as if to clear his thoughts and gestures for me to exit before him in a most gentlemanly manner. Who * s he kidding ? He * s no gentleman. He has my panties .
