"* Oh , Ana ! * His breathing is ragged in my ear , in perfect synergy with mine. * Oh , baby , will I ever get enough of you ? * he whispers . We sink slowly to the floor , and he wraps his arms around me , imprisoning me. Will it always be like this ? So overwhelming , so all-consuming , so bewildering and beguiling. I wanted to talk , but now I * m spent and dazed from his lovemaking and wondering if I will ever get enough of him ? I am curled on his lap , my head against his chest , as we both calm. Very subtly , I inhale his sweet , intoxicating Christian scent. I must not nuzzle. I must not nuzzle. I repeat the mantra in my head * though I am so tempted to do so.

Maybe there * s a reasonable explanation , and I * m overreacting * wild hope blossoms in my chest , hope that I am wrong . * What is it ? * Christian * s face is wide-eyed with alarm . * Your scars , * I whisper. * They * re not from chicken pox. * I watch as in a split second he closes down , his stance changing from relaxed , calm , and at ease to defensive * angry even. He frowns , his face darkening , and his mouth presses"
