"I concentrate on packing , sharing a bottle of cheap red wine as we do. When I finally go to bed , having almost finished packing my room , I feel calmer. The physical activity of boxing everything up has been a welcome distraction , and I * m tired. I want a good night * s rest. I snuggle into my bed and am soon asleep . PAUL IS BACK FROM Princeton before he sets off for New York to start an internship with a financing company. He follows me around the store all day asking me for a date. It * s annoying . * Paul , for the hundredth time , I have a date this evening. * * No , you don * t , you * re just saying that to avoid me. You * re always avoiding me. * Yes * you * d think you * d take the hint . * Paul , I never thought it was a good idea to date the boss * s brother. * * You * re finishing here on Friday. You * re not working tomorrow. * * And I * ll be in Seattle as of Saturday and you * ll be in New York soon. We couldn * t get much farther apart if we tried. Besides , I do have a date this evening. * * With Jos * ? * * No. * * Who then ? * * Paul * oh. * My sigh is exasperated. He * s not going to let this go. * Christian Grey. * I can not help the annoyance in my voice. But it does the trick. Paul * s mouth falls open , and he gapes at me , struck dumb. Humph * even his name renders people speechless . * You have a date with Christian Grey ? * he says finally , once he * s over the shock. Disbelief is evident in his voice . * Yes. * * I see. * Paul looks positively crestfallen , stunned even , and a very small part of me resents that he should find this a surprise. My inner goddess does , too. She makes a very vulgar and unattractive gesture at him with her fingers . After that , he ignores me , and at five I am out the door , pronto . Kate has lent me two dresses and two pairs of shoes for tonight and for graduation tomorrow. I wish I could feel more enthused about clothes and make an extra effort , but clothes are just not my thing. What is your thing , Anastasia ? Christian * s softly spoken question haunts me. Shaking my head and endeavoring to quell my nerves , I decide on the plum-colored sheath dress for this evening. It * s demure and vaguely businesslike * after all , I am negotiating a contract . I shower , shave my legs"
