"teaspoon. As I place the used teabag back on the side plate , he cocks his head , gazing quizzically at me . * I like my tea black and weak , * I mutter as an explanation . * I see. Is he your boyfriend ? * Whoa * What ? * Who ? * * The photographer. Jos * Rodriguez. * I laugh , nervous but curious. What gave him that impression ? * No. Jos * * s a good friend of mine , that * s all. Why did you think he was my boyfriend ? * * The way you smiled at him , and he at you. * His gaze holds mine. He * s so unnerving. I want to look away but I * m caught * spellbound . * He * s more like family , * I whisper . Grey nods , seemingly satisfied with my response , and glances down at his blueberry muffin. His long fingers deftly peel back the paper , and I watch , fascinated . * Do you want some ? * he asks , and that amused , secret smile is back . * No thanks. * I frown and stare down at my hands again . * And the boy I met yesterday , at the store. He * s not your boyfriend ? * * No. Paul * s just a friend. I told you yesterday. * Oh , this is getting silly. * Why do you ask ? * * You seem nervous around men. * Holy crap , that * s personal. I * m just nervous around you , Grey . * I find you intimidating. * I flush scarlet , but mentally pat myself on the back for my candor , and gaze at my hands again. I hear his sharp intake of breath . * You should find me intimidating. * He nods. * You * re very honest. Please don * t look down. I like to see your face. * Oh. I glance at him , and he gives me an encouraging but wry smile . * It gives me some sort of clue what you might be thinking , * he breathes. * You * re a mystery , Miss Steele. * Mysterious ? Me ? * There * s nothing mysterious about me. * * I think you * re very self-contained , * he murmurs . Am I ? Wow * how am I managing that ? This is bewildering. Me , self-contained ? No way . * Except when you blush , of course , which is often. I just wish I knew what you were blushing about. * He pops a small piece of muffin into his mouth and starts to chew it slowly , not taking his eyes off me. And as if on cue , I blush. Crap ! * Do you always make such personal observations ? *"
