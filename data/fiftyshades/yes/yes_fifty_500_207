"* Oh , shit * can * t he just get this over with ? I * m not sure if I can stand. Hesitantly , I clamber to my feet. He holds his hand out , and I place the condom in his palm. Suddenly he grabs me , tipping me across his lap. With one smooth movement , he angles his body so my torso is resting on the bed beside him.
