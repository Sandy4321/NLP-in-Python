"him. I move my hands and rather awkwardly , given I * m restrained , feel his hair. He stops kissing me and glares up at me , shaking his head from side to side , tutting as he does. He reaches for my hands and places them above my head again . * Don * t move your hands , or we just have to start all over again , * he scolds me mildly. Oh , he * s such a tease . * I want to touch you. * My voice is all breathy and out of control . * I know , * he murmurs. * Keep your hands above your head , * he orders , his voice forceful . He cups my chin again and starts to kiss my throat as before. Oh * he * s so frustrating. His hands run down my body and over my breasts as he reaches the dip at the base of my neck with his lips.

I squeeze my eyes shut and try to absorb and manage all the sensations he * s creating. He kisses my ankle and trails kisses up my calf to my knee , stopping just above. He then starts on my right foot , repeating the whole , seductive , mind-blowing process . * Oh , please , * I moan as he bites my little"
