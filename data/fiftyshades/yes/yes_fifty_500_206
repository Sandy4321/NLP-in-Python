He nods slowly , and then he grins , teasing. * Could get really ugly. * His grin is infectious . * Ugly , how ? * * Oh , you know , explosions , car chases , kidnapping , incarceration. * * You * d kidnap me ? * * Oh yes. * He grins . * Hold me against my will ? * Jeez , this is hot . * Oh yes. * He nods. * And then we * re talking TPE 24/7. * * You * ve lost me , * I breathe , my heart is pounding * is he serious ? * Total Power Exchange * around the clock. * His eyes are shining , and his excitement is palpable even from where I sit . Holy shit . * So you have no choice , * he says sardonically . * Clearly. * I can * t keep the sarcasm out of my voice as my eyes reach for the heavens . * Oh , Anastasia Steele , did you just roll your eyes at me ? * Crap . * No , * I squeak . * I think you did.

Do it ! my inner goddess pleads with me. My subconscious is as paralyzed as I am . * I * m waiting , * he says. * I * m not a patient man. * Oh , for the love of all that * s holy. I * m panting , afraid , turned on. Blood pounding through my body , my legs like jelly. Slowly , I crawl over to him until I am beside him . * Good girl , * he murmurs. * Now stand up."
