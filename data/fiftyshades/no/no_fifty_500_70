"beside me to strap me into the harness. It * s a four-point harness with all the straps connecting to one central buckle. He tightens both of the upper straps , so I can hardly move. He * s so close and intent on what he * s doing. If I could only lean forward , my nose would be in his hair. He smells clean , fresh , heavenly , but I * m fastened securely into my seat and effectively immobile. He glances up and smiles , like he * s enjoying his usual private joke , his eyes heated. He * s so tantalizingly close. I hold my breath as he pulls at one of the upper straps . * You * re secure , no escaping , * he whispers. * Breathe , Anastasia , * he adds softly. Reaching up , he caresses my cheek , running his long fingers down to my chin , which he grasps between his thumb and forefinger. He leans forward and plants a brief , chaste kiss , leaving me reeling , my insides clenching at the thrilling , unexpected touch of his lips . * I like this harness , * he whispers . What ? He sits down beside me and buckles himself into his seat , then begins a protracted procedure of checking gauges and flipping switches and buttons from the mind-boggling array of dials and lights and switches in front of me. Little lights wink and flash from various dials , and the whole of the instrument panel lights up . * Put your cans on , * he says , pointing to a set of headphones in front of me. I pull them on , and the rotor blades start. They are deafening. He puts his headphones on and continues flipping various switches . * I * m just going through all the preflight checks. * Christian * s disembodied voice is in my ears through the headphones. I turn and grin at him . * Do you know what you are doing ? * I ask. He turns and smiles at me . * I * ve been a fully qualified pilot for four years , Anastasia. You * re safe with me. * He gives me a wolfish grin. * Well , while we * re flying , * he adds , and winks at me . Winking * Christian ! * Are you ready ? * I nod , wide-eyed . * Okay , tower. PDX , this is Charlie Tango Golf * Golf Echo Hotel , cleared for take-off. Please confirm , over. * * Charlie Tango * you are clear. PDX to call , proceed to one four thousand , heading zero one zero , over. * * Roger , tower , Charlie Tango set , over and out. Here we go , * he adds to me , and the helicopter rises slowly and smoothly into the air"
