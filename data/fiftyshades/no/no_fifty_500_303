"* * You look lovely , dear. * * Oh , this is Kate * s dress. You like it ? * Her frown deepens . * Why are you wearing Kate * s dress ? * Oh * no . * Well , I like this one and she doesn * t , * I improvise quickly . She regards me shrewdly while Bob oozes impatience with his hangdog , hungry look . * I * ll take you shopping tomorrow , * she says . * Oh , Mom , you don * t need to do that. I have plenty of clothes. * * Can * t I do something for my own daughter ? Come on , Bob * s starving. * * Too right , * moans Bob , rubbing his stomach and assuming a fake pained expression . I giggle as he rolls his eyes , and we head out the door . Later when I * m in the shower , cooling under the lukewarm water , I reflect on how much my mother has changed.

When did that start happening ? Since I met Christian. Why is that ? When I * m done , I dry myself quickly , keen to get back to Christian. There * s an e-mail waiting for me , sent just after I left for dinner a few hours ago .
