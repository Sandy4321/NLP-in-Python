"I can feel the fronds of the flogger flowing over my skin , following the same path as the fur , and it * s so hard to concentrate with the music in my head * it sounds like a hundred voices singing , weaving an ethereal tapestry of fine , silken gold and silver through my head , mixed with the feel of the soft suede against my skin * trailing over me * oh my * abruptly , it disappears. Then suddenly , sharply , it bites down on my belly . * Aagghh ! * I cry out. It takes me by surprise , but it doesn * t exactly hurt and tingles all over , and he hits me again. Harder . * Aaah ! * I want to move , to writhe * to escape , or to welcome , each blow * I don * t know * it * s so overwhelming * I can * t pull my arms * my legs are stuck * I am held very firmly in place * and again he strikes across my breasts * I cry out. And it * s a sweet agony * bearable , just * pleasant * no , not immediately , but as my skin sings with each blow in perfect counterpoint to the music in my head , I am dragged into a dark , dark part of my psyche that surrenders to this most erotic sensation. Yes * I get this. He hits me across my hip , then moves in swift blows over my pubic hair , on my thighs , and down my inner thighs * and back up my body * across my hips. He keeps going as the music reaches a climax , and then suddenly the music stops. And so does he. Then the singing starts again * building and building , and he rains down blows on me * and I groan and writhe. Once again , it ceases and all is quiet * except my wild breathing * and wild yearning. For * oh * what * s happening ? What * s he going to do now ? The excitement is almost unbearable. I * ve entered a very dark , carnal place . The bed moves and shifts as I feel him clamber over me , and the song starts again. He * s got it on repeat * this time it * s his nose and lips that take the place of the fur * running down my neck and throat , kissing , sucking * trailing down to my breasts * Ah ! Taunting each of my nipples in turn * his tongue swirling around one while his fingers relentlessly tease the other * I groan , loudly I think , though I can * t hear. I am lost. Lost in him * lost in the astral , seraphic voices * lost to all the sensations"
