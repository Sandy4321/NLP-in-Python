"it * s obvious that I * m just visiting. I don * t fit in here at all. Nothing changes. I inwardly sigh. Thanking her , I walk over to the bank of elevators and past the two security men who are both far more smartly dressed than I am in their well-cut black suits . The elevator whisks me at terminal velocity to the twentieth floor. The doors slide open , and I * m in another large lobby * again all glass , steel , and white sandstone. I * m confronted by another desk of sandstone and another young blonde woman , this time dressed impeccably in black and white , who rises to greet me . * Miss Steele , could you wait here , please ? * She points to a seated area of white leather chairs . Behind the leather chairs is a spacious glass-walled meeting room with an equally spacious dark wood table and at least twenty matching chairs around it. Beyond that , there is a floor-to-ceiling window with a view of the Seattle skyline that looks out through the city toward the Sound. It * s a stunning vista , and I * m momentarily paralyzed by the view. Wow . I sit down , fish the questions from my backpack , and go through them , inwardly cursing Kate for not providing me with a brief biography. I know nothing about this man I * m about to interview. He could be ninety or he could be thirty. The uncertainty is galling , and my nerves resurface , making me fidget. I * ve never been comfortable with one-on-one interviews , preferring the anonymity of a group discussion where I can sit inconspicuously at the back of the room. To be honest , I prefer my own company , reading a classic British novel , curled up in a chair in the campus library. Not sitting twitching nervously in a colossal glass-and-stone edifice . I roll my eyes at myself. Get a grip , Steele. Judging from the building , which is too clinical and modern , I guess Grey is in his forties : fit , tanned , and fair-haired to match the rest of the personnel . Another elegant , flawlessly dressed blonde comes out of a large door to the right. What is it with all the immaculate blondes ? It * s like Stepford here. Taking a deep breath , I stand up . * Miss Steele ? * the latest blonde asks . * Yes , * I croak , and clear my throat. * Yes. * There , that sounded more confident . * Mr. Grey will see you in a moment. May I take your jacket ? * * Oh , please. * I struggle out of the jacket . * Have you been offered any refreshment ? * * Um * no. * Oh dear , is Blonde Number One in"
