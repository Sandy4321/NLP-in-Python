"coursing through me. Could I be any more excited ? * Stand here. * I am facing the bed. He leans down and whispers in my ear . * Wait here. Keep your eyes on the bed. Picture yourself lying here bound and totally at my mercy. * Oh my . He moves away for a moment , and I can hear him near the door fetching something. All my senses are hyperalert , my hearing more acute. He * s picked up something from the rack of whips and paddles by the door. Holy cow. What is he going to do ? I feel him behind me.
