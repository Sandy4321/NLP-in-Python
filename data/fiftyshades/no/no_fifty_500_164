"don * t sign. If you do sign and then decide you don * t like it , there are enough get-out clauses so you can walk away. Even if it were legally binding , do you think I * d drag you through the courts if you did decide to run ? * I take a long sip of my wine. My subconscious taps me hard on the shoulder. You must keep your wits about you. Don * t drink too much . * Relationships like this are built on honesty and trust , * he continues. * If you don * t trust me * trust me to know how I * m affecting you , how far I can go with you , how far I can take you * if you can * t be honest with me , then we really can * t do this. * Oh my , we * ve cut to the chase quickly. How far he can take me. Holy shit. What does that mean ? * So it * s quite simple , Anastasia. Do you trust me or not ? * His eyes are burning , fervent . * Did you have similar discussions with , um * the fifteen ? * * No. * * Why not ? * * Because they were all established submissives. They knew what they wanted out of a relationship with me and generally what I expected. With them , it was just a question of fine-tuning the soft limits , details like that. * * Is there a store you go to ? Submissives * * * Us ? * He laughs. * Not exactly. * * Then how ? * * Is that what you want to discuss ? Or shall we get down to the nitty-gritty ? Your issues , as you say. * I swallow. Do I trust him ? Is that what this all comes down to * trust ? Surely that should be a two-way thing. I remember his snit when I phoned Jos * . * Are you hungry ? * he asks , distracting me from my thoughts . Oh no * food . * No. * * Have you eaten today ? * I stare at him. Honesty * Holy crap , he * s not going to like my answer . * No. * My voice is small . He narrows his eyes . * You have to eat , Anastasia. We can eat down here or in my suite. What would you prefer ? * * I think we should stay in public , on neutral ground. * He smiles sardonically . * Do you think that would stop me ? * he says softly , a sensual warning . My eyes widen , and I swallow again . * I hope so. * * Come , I have a private dining room booked. No public. * He smiles at me"
