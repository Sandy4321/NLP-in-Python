"* I hadn * t realized I was. Have I offended you ? * He sounds surprised . * No , * I answer truthfully . * Good. * * But you * re very high-handed. * He raises his eyebrows and , if I * m not mistaken , flushes slightly , too . * I * m used to getting my own way , Anastasia , * he murmurs. * In all things. * * I don * t doubt it. Why haven * t you asked me to call you by your first name ? * I * m surprised by my audacity. Why has this conversation become so serious ? This isn * t going the way I thought it was going to go. I can * t believe I * m feeling so antagonistic toward him. It * s like he * s trying to warn me off . * The only people who use my given name are my family and a few close friends. That * s the way I like it. * Oh. He still hasn * t said , * Call me Christian. * He is a control freak , there * s no other explanation , and part of me is thinking maybe it would have been better if Kate had interviewed him. Two control freaks together. Plus , of course , she * s almost blond * well , strawberry blond * like all the women in his office. And she * s beautiful , my subconscious reminds me. I don * t like the idea of Christian and Kate. I take a sip of my tea , and Grey eats another small piece of his muffin . * Are you an only child ? * he asks . Whoa * he keeps changing direction . * Yes. * * Tell me about your parents. * Why does he want to know this ? It * s so dull . * My mom lives in Georgia with her new husband , Bob. My stepdad lives in Montesano. * * Your father ? * * My father died when I was a baby. * * I * m sorry , * he mutters , and a fleeting , troubled look crosses his face . * I don * t remember him. * * And your mother remarried ? * I snort . * You could say that. * He frowns at me . * You * re not giving much away , are you ? * he says dryly , rubbing his chin as if in deep thought . * Neither are you. * * You * ve interviewed me once already , and I can recollect some quite probing questions then. * He smirks at me . Holy shit. He * s remembering the * gay * question. Once again , I * m mortified. In years to come , I know I * ll need intensive therapy to"
