"up a chair , Christian. * * Thank you , Mrs. Adams. * Christian pulls a nearby chair over and sits gracefully down beside me . * So you just happen to be staying in the hotel where we * re drinking ? * I ask , trying hard to keep my tone light . * Or you just happen to be drinking in the hotel where I * m staying , * Christian replies. * I just finished dinner , came in here , and saw you. I was distracted , thinking about your most recent e-mail , and I glance up and there you are. Quite a coincidence , eh ? * He cocks his head to one side , and I see a trace of a smile. Thank heavens * we may be able to save the evening after all . * My mother and I were shopping this morning and on the beach this afternoon. We decided on a few cocktails this evening , * I mutter , feeling that I owe him some sort of explanation . * Did you buy that top ? * He nods at my brand-new green silk camisole. * The color suits you. And you * ve caught some sun. You look lovely. * I flush , speechless at his compliment . * Well , I was going to pay you a visit tomorrow. But here you are. * He reaches over , takes my hand , and squeezes it gently , running his thumb across my knuckles to and fro * and I feel the familiar pull. The electric charge zapping beneath my skin under the gentle pressure from his thumb , firing into my bloodstream and pulsing around my body , heating everything in its path. It * s been more than two days since I saw him. Oh my * I want him. My breath hitches. I blink at him , smiling shyly , and see a smile play on his lips . * I thought I * d surprise you. But as ever , Anastasia , you surprise me by being here. * I glance quickly at Mom , who is staring at Christian * yes staring ! Stop it , Mom. As if he * s some exotic creature , never seen before. I mean , I know I * ve never had a boyfriend , and Christian only qualifies as such for ease of reference * but is it so unbelievable that I could attract a man ? This man ? Yes , frankly * look at him ! my subconscious snaps. Oh , shut up ! Who invited you to the party ? I scowl at my mom * but she doesn * t seem to notice . * I don * t want to interrupt the time you have with your mother. I * ll have a quick drink and then retire. I have work to do , * he states earnestly"
