", * he whispers. I glance at the rack of canes as he says this . * And where does all this fit in ? * I wave my hand in the general direction of the room . * It * s all part of the incentive package. Both reward and punishment. * * So you * ll get your kicks by exerting your will over me. * * It * s about gaining your trust and your respect , so you * ll let me exert my will over you. I will gain a great deal of pleasure , joy even , in your submission.

You * re expecting me to move in ? * I can * t hide the horror in my voice . * Not full time. Just , say , Friday evening through Sunday. We have to talk about all that , negotiate. If you want to do this , * he adds , his voice quiet and hesitant . * I * ll sleep here ? * *"
