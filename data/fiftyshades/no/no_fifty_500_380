"up my hands . * Don * t , please. * I recoil from him. There * s no way I can tolerate his touch now , it will slay me. * I can * t do this. * Grabbing my suitcase and my backpack , I head for the foyer. He follows me , keeping a careful distance. He presses the elevator button , and the doors open. I climb in . * Good-bye , Christian , * I murmur . * Ana , good-bye , * he says softly , and he looks utterly , utterly broken , a man in agonizing pain , reflecting how I feel inside.

I head straight to my room , and there , hanging limply at the end of my bed , is a very sad , deflated helicopter balloon. Charlie Tango , looking and feeling exactly like me. I grab it angrily off my bedrail , snapping the tie , and hug it to me. Oh * what have I done ? I fall onto my bed , shoes and all , and howl. The pain is indescribable * physical , mental * metaphysical * it is everywhere , seeping into the marrow of my bones. Grief. This is grief * and I * ve brought it"
