"standby at Hilton Head. I can go. * He * s angry with me * no . * No * don * t go. Please. I * m thrilled you * re here. I * m just trying to make you understand. I * m angry that as soon as I left , you had dinner with her. Think about how you are when I get anywhere near Jos * . Jos * is a good friend. I have never had a sexual relationship with him. Whereas you and her * * I trail off , unwilling to take that thought further . * You * re jealous ? * He stares at me , dumbfounded , and his eyes soften slightly , warming . * Yes , and angry about what she did to you. * * Anastasia , she helped me. That * s all I * ll say about that. And as for your jealousy , put yourself in my shoes. I haven * t had to justify my actions to anyone in the last seven years. Not one person. I do as I wish , Anastasia. I like my autonomy. I didn * t go and see Mrs. Robinson to upset you. I went because every now and then we have dinner. She * s a friend and a business partner. * Business partner ? Holy crap. This is news . He gazes at me , assessing my expression. * Yes , we * re business partners. The sex is over between us. It has been for years. * * Why did your relationship end ? * His mouth narrows and his eyes gleam. * Her husband found out. * Holy shit ! * Can we talk about this some other time * somewhere more private ? * he growls . * I don * t think you * ll ever convince me that she * s not some kind of pedophile. * * I don * t think of her that way. I never have. Now that * s enough ! * he snaps . * Did you love her ? * * How are you two getting on ? * My mother has returned , unseen by either of us . I plaster a fake smile on my face as both Christian and I lean back hastily * guiltily. She gazes at me . * Fine , Mom. * Christian sips his drink , watching me closely , his expression guarded. What is he thinking ? Did he love her ? I think if he did , I will lose it , big time . * Well , ladies , I shall leave you to your evening. * No * no * he can * t leave me hanging like this . * Please , put these drinks on my tab , room number 612. I * ll call you in the morning , Anastasia. Until tomorrow , Carla. * * Oh , it"
