"die for. She doesn * t do it on purpose , I know , but I haul my sorry , perspiration-clad ass into my room on the pretext of packing more boxes. Could I feel any more inadequate ? Taking the awesome free technology with me , I set the laptop up on my desk. I e-mail Christian . From : Anastasia Steele Subject : Shocked of WSUV Date : May 23 2011 20 : 33 To : Christian Grey Okay , I * ve seen enough . It was nice knowing you . Ana I press * send , * hugging myself , laughing at my little joke. Will he find it as funny ? Oh , shit * probably not. Christian Grey is not famed for his sense of humor. But I know it exists , I * ve experienced it. Perhaps I * ve gone too far. I wait for his answer . I wait * and wait. I glance at my alarm clock. Ten minutes have passed . To distract myself from the anxiety that blooms in my belly , I start doing what I told Kate I would be doing * packing up my room. I begin by cramming my books into a crate. By nine , I * ve heard nothing. Perhaps he * s out. I pout petulantly as I plug my iPod earbuds in , listen to Snow Patrol , and sit down at my small desk to reread the contract and make my comments . I don * t know why I glance up , maybe I catch a slight movement from the corner of my eye , I don * t know , but when I do , he * s standing in the doorway of my bedroom , watching me intently. He * s wearing his gray flannel pants and a white linen shirt , gently twirling his car keys. I pull my earbuds out and freeze. Fuck ! * Good evening , Anastasia. * His voice is cool , his expression completely guarded and unreadable. The capacity to speak deserts me. Damn Kate for letting him in here with no warning. Vaguely , I * m aware that I * m still in my sweats , unshowered , yucky , and he * s just gloriously yummy , his pants doing that hanging from the hips thing , and what * s more , he * s here in my bedroom . * I felt that your e-mail warranted a reply in person , * he explains dryly . I open my mouth and then close it again , twice. The joke is on me. Never in this or any alternative universe did I expect him to drop everything and turn up here . * May I sit ? * he asks , his eyes now dancing with humor * thank heavens * maybe he * ll see the funny side ? I nod. The power of speech"
