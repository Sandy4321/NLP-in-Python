", and drives away . Apartment , Beetle , Clayton * s * it * s all change now. I shake my head as I wander back inside. And the biggest change of all is Christian Grey. Taylor thinks he * s a good man. Can I believe him ? JOS * JOINS US WITH Chinese takeout at eight. We * re done. We * re packed and ready to go. He brings several bottles of beer , and Kate and I sit on the couch while he * s cross-legged on the floor between us. We watch crap TV , drink beer , and , as the evening wears on , we fondly and loudly reminisce as the beer takes effect. It * s been a good four years . The atmosphere between Jos * and me has returned to normal , the attempted kiss forgotten. Well , it * s been swept under the rug that my inner goddess is lying on , eating grapes and tapping her fingers , waiting not so patiently for Sunday. There * s a knock on the door , and my heart leaps into my throat. Is it * ? Kate answers the door and is nearly knocked off her feet by Elliot. He seizes her in a Hollywood-style clinch that moves quickly into a European art house embrace. Honestly * get a room. Jos * and I stare at each other. I * m appalled at their lack of modesty . * Shall we walk down to the bar ? * I ask Jos * , who nods frantically. We are too uncomfortable with the unrestrained sexing unfolding in front of us. Kate looks up at me , flushed and bright-eyed . * Jos * and I are going for a quick drink. * I roll my eyes at her. Ha ! I can still roll my eyes in my own time . * Okay. * She grins . * Hi , Elliot. Bye , Elliot. * He winks a big blue eye at me , and Jos * and I are out the door , giggling like teenagers . As we stroll down to the bar , I put my arm through Jos * * s. God , he * s so uncomplicated * I hadn * t really appreciated that before . * You * ll still come to the opening of my show , won * t you ? * * Of course , Jos * , when is it ? * * June ninth. * * What day is that ? * I suddenly panic . * It * s a Thursday. * * Yeah , I should make that * and you will visit us in Seattle ? * * Try to stop me. * He grins . IT * S LATE WHEN I arrive back from the bar. Kate and Elliot are nowhere to be seen , but boy , can they be heard. Holy"
