", Ana. No * that * s wrong. * He * s horrified . * Wrong ? Why * s it wrong ? * * Well , look at you. I can * t make you happy. * His voice is anguished . * But you do make me happy. * I frown . * Not at the moment , not doing what I want to do. * Holy fuck. This really is it. This is what it boils down to * incompatibility * and all those poor subs come to mind . * We * ll never get past that , will we ? * I whisper , my scalp prickling in fear . He shakes his head bleakly. I close my eyes. I can not bear to look at him . * Well * I * d better go , then , * I murmur , wincing as I sit up . * No , don * t go. * He sounds panicked . * There * s no point in me staying. * Suddenly , I feel tired , really dog-tired , and I want to go now. I climb out of bed , and Christian follows . * I * m going to get dressed. I * d like some privacy , * I say , my voice flat and empty as I leave him standing in the bedroom . Heading downstairs , I glance at the great room , thinking how only hours before I had rested my head on his shoulder as he played the piano. So much has happened since then. I have had my eyes opened and glimpsed the extent of his depravity , and I now know he * s not capable of love * of giving or receiving love. My worst fears have been realized. And strangely , it * s liberating . The pain is such that I refuse to acknowledge it. I feel numb. I have somehow escaped from my body and am now a casual observer to this unfolding tragedy. I shower quickly and methodically , thinking only of each second in front of me. Now squeeze body wash bottle. Put body wash bottle back in rack. Rub cloth on face , on shoulders * on and on , all simple , mechanical actions , requiring simple , mechanical thoughts . I finish my shower * and as I haven * t washed my hair , I can dry myself quickly. I dress in the bathroom , taking my jeans and T-shirt out of my small suitcase. My jeans chafe against my backside , but quite frankly , it * s a pain I welcome as it distracts my mind from what * s happening to my splintering , shattered heart . I stoop to shut my suitcase and the bag holding Christian * s gift catches my eye , a model kit for a Blanik L23 glider , something for him to build. Tears threaten. Oh"
