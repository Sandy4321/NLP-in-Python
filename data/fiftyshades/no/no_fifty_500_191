", chaste kiss on my lips. * Please. * He releases me . Ho , my subconscious mouths at me . * It makes me feel cheap , * I murmur . Christian runs his hand through his hair , exasperated . * It shouldn * t. You * re overthinking it , Anastasia. Don * t place some vague moral judgment on yourself based on what others might think. Don * t waste your energy. It * s only because you have reservations about our arrangement ; that * s perfectly natural. You don * t know what you * re getting yourself into. * I frown , trying to process his words . * Hey , stop this , * he commands softly , cupping my chin again and pulling at it gently so I release my lower lip from my teeth. * There is nothing about you that is cheap , Anastasia. I won * t have you thinking that. I just bought you some old books that I thought might mean something to you , that * s all. Have some champagne. * His eyes warm and soften , and I smile tentatively up at him. * That * s better , * he murmurs. He picks up the champagne , takes off the foil top and cage , twists the bottle rather than the cork , and opens it with a small pop and a practiced flourish that doesn * t spill a drop. He half fills the cups . * It * s pink , * I murmur , surprised . * Bollinger Grande Ann * e Ros * 1999 , an excellent vintage , * he says with relish . * In teacups. * He grins . * In teacups. Congratulations on your degree , Anastasia. * We clink cups , and he takes a drink , but I can * t help thinking this is really about my capitulation . * Thank you , * I murmur , and take a sip. Of course it * s delicious. * Shall we go through the soft limits ? * He smiles , and I blush . * Always so eager. * Christian takes my hand and leads me to the couch , where he sits and tugs me down beside him . * Your stepfather * s a very taciturn man. * Oh * not soft limits , then. I just want to get this out of the way ; the anxiety is gnawing at me . * You managed to get him eating out of your hand. * I pout . Christian laughs softly . * Only because I know how to fish. * * How did you know he liked fishing ? * * You told me. When we went for coffee. * * Oh * did I ? * I take another sip. Wow , he has a memory for detail. Hmm * this champagne really is very good. *"
