"* * I * m really not hungry , * I whisper . His eyes narrow. * I would really like you to finish your breakfast. * * What is it with you and food ? * I blurt out. His brow knits . * I told you , I have issues with wasted food. Eat , * he snaps. His eyes are dark , pained . Holy crap. What is that all about ? I pick up my fork and eat slowly , trying to chew. I must remember not to put so much on my plate if he * s going to be weird about food. His expression softens as I carefully make my way through my breakfast. I note that he cleans his plate. He waits for me to finish , and then he clears my plate . * You cooked , I * ll clear. * * That * s very democratic. * * Yes. * He frowns. * Not my usual style. After I * ve done this , we * ll take a bath. * * Oh , okay. * Oh my * I * d much rather have a shower. My cell rings , interrupting my reverie. It * s Kate . * Hi. * I wander over to the glass doors of the balcony , away from him . * Ana , why didn * t you text last night ? * She * s angry . * I * m sorry , I was overtaken by events. * * You * re okay ? * * Yes , I * m fine. * * Did you ? * She * s fishing for information. I roll my eyes at the expectation in her voice . * Kate , I don * t want to talk over the phone. * Christian glances up at me . * You did * I can tell. * How can she tell ? She * s bluffing , and I can * t talk about this. I * ve signed a damned agreement . * Kate , please. * * What was it like ? Are you okay ? * * I * ve told you I * m okay. * * Was he gentle ? * * Kate , please ! * I can * t hide my exasperation . * Ana , don * t hold out on me , I * ve been waiting for this day for nearly four years. * * I * ll see you this evening. * I hang up . That is going to be one difficult square to circle. She * s so tenacious , and she wants to know * in detail , and I can * t tell her because I * ve signed a * what was it called ? NDA. She * ll freak and rightly so. I need a plan. I head back to watch Christian move gracefully around his kitchen ."
