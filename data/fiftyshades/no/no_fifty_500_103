"* No. I wondered if we should continue your basic training. * * Oh. * I stare at him dumbfounded as I stop breathing and everything inside me clenches tight. Ooh * that * s so nice. I suppress my groan . * Eat , Anastasia. * My appetite has become uncertain again * more * more sex * yes , please . * This is delicious , incidentally. * He grins at me . I try a forkful of omelet but can barely taste it. Basic training ! I want to fuck your mouth. Does that form part of basic training ? * Stop biting your lip. It * s very distracting , and I happen to know you * re not wearing anything under my shirt , which makes it even more distracting. * I dunk my teabag in the small pot that Christian has provided. My mind is in a whirl . * What sort of basic training did you have in mind ? * I ask , my voice slightly too high , betraying my wish to sound as natural , disinterested , and calm as I can with my hormones wreaking havoc through my body . * Well , as you * re sore , I thought we could stick to oral skills. * I choke on my tea , and I stare at him , eyes wide and mouth gaping. He pats me gently on the back and passes me some orange juice. I can not tell what he * s thinking . * That * s if you want to stay , * he adds. I glance up at him , trying to recover my equilibrium. His expression is unreadable. It * s so frustrating . * I * d like to stay for today. If that * s okay. I have to work tomorrow. * * What time do you have to be at work tomorrow ? * * Nine. * * I * ll get you to work by nine tomorrow. * I frown. Does he want me to stay another night ? * I * ll need to go home tonight * I need clean clothes. * * We can get you some here. * I don * t have spare cash to spend on clothes. His hand comes up , and he grasps my chin , tugging it so my lip is released from the grip of my teeth. I * m not even aware I * ve been biting my lip . * What is it ? * he asks . * I need to be home this evening. * His mouth is a hard line . * Okay , this evening , * he acquiesces. * Now eat your breakfast. * My thoughts and my stomach are in turmoil. My appetite has vanished. I stare at my half-eaten breakfast. I * m just not hungry . * Eat , Anastasia. You didn * t eat last night."
