"me , * he growls , and suddenly , with one fluid movement , he clears all the plans and papers off his desk so that they scatter on the floor , sweeps me up in his arms , and lays me down across the short end of his desk so that my head is almost off the edge . * You want it , you got it , baby , * he mutters , producing a foil packet from his pants pocket while he unzips his pants. Oh , Mr. Boy Scout. He rolls the condom over his erection and gazes down at me. * I sure hope you * re ready , * he breathes , a salacious smile across his face. And in a moment , he * s filling me , holding my wrists tightly by my side , and thrusting into me deeply . I groan * oh yes . * Christ , Ana. You * re so ready , * he whispers in veneration . Wrapping my legs around his waist , I hold him the only way I can as he stays standing , staring down at me , gray eyes glowing , passionate and possessive. He starts to move , really move. This is not making love , this is fucking * and I love it. I groan. It * s so raw , so carnal , making me so wanton. I revel in his possession , his lust slaking mine. He moves with ease , luxuriating in me , enjoying me , his lips slightly parted as his breathing increases. He twists his hips from side to side , and the feeling is exquisite . I close my eyes , feeling the build up * that delicious , slow , step-climbing build. Pushing me higher , higher to the castle in the air. Oh yes * his stroke increases fractionally. I moan loudly. I am all sensation * all him , enjoying every thrust , every push that fills me. And he picks up the pace , thrusting faster * harder * and my whole body is moving to his rhythm , and I can feel my legs stiffening , and my insides quivering and quickening . * Come on , baby , give it up for me , * he cajoles through gritted teeth , and the fervent need in his voice * the strain * sends me over the edge . I cry out a wordless , passionate plea as I touch the sun and burn , falling around him , falling down , back to a breathless , bright summit on Earth. He slams into me and stops abruptly as he reaches his climax , pulling at my wrists and sinking gracefully and wordlessly onto me . Wow * that was unexpected. I slowly materialize back on Earth . * What the hell are you doing to me ? * he breathes as he nuzzles my neck. *"
