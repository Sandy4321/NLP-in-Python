"are all fictional : Elizabeth Bennet would be outraged , Jane Eyre too frightened , and Tess would succumb , just as I have . * I haven * t finished my cod. * * You * d prefer cold cod to me ? * My head jerks up to glare at him , and his eyes burn molten silver with compelling need . * I thought you liked me to clear my plate. * * Right now , Miss Steele , I couldn * t give a fuck about your food. * * Christian. You just don * t fight fair. * * I know. I never have. * My inner goddess frowns at me. You can do this , she coaxes * play this sex god at his own game. Can I ? Okay. What to do ? My inexperience is an albatross around my neck. Picking up a spear of asparagus , I gaze at him and bite my lip. Then very slowly put the tip of my cold asparagus in my mouth and suck it . Christian * s eyes widen infinitesimally , but I notice . * Anastasia. What are you doing ? * I bite off the tip . * Eating my asparagus. * Christian shifts in his seat . * I think you * re toying with me , Miss Steele. * I feign innocence. * I * m just finishing my food , Mr. Grey. * The waiter chooses this moment to knock and , unbidden , enter. He glances briefly at Christian , who frowns at him but then nods , so the waiter clears our plates. The waiter * s arrival has broken the spell. And I grasp this precious moment of clarity. I have to go. Our meeting will only end one way if I stay , and I need some boundaries after such an intense conversation. As much as my body craves his touch , my mind is rebelling. I need some distance to think about all he * s said. I still haven * t made a decision , and his sexual allure and prowess doesn * t make it any easier . * Would you like some dessert ? * Christian asks , ever the gentleman , but his eyes still blaze . * No thank you. I think I should go. * I stare down at my hands . * Go ? * He can * t hide his surprise . The waiter leaves hastily . * Yes. * It * s the right decision. If I stay here , in this room with him , he will fuck me. I stand , purposefully. * We both have the graduation ceremony tomorrow. * Christian stands automatically , revealing years of ingrained civility . * I don * t want you to go. * * Please * I have to. * * Why ? * * Because you * ve given me so much to consider"
