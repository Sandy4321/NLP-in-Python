"offers some to Kate. Mia takes her seat beside Christian and , grabbing his hand , squeezes it tightly. Christian smiles warmly at her . * Where did you meet , Ana ? * Mia asks him . * She interviewed me for the WSU student newspaper. * * Which Kate edits , * I add , hoping to steer the conversation away from me . Mia beams at Kate , seated opposite next to Elliot , and they start talking about the student newspaper . * Wine , Ana ? * Mr. Grey asks . * Please. * I smile at him. Mr. Grey rises to fill the rest of the glasses . I peek up at Christian , and he turns to look at me , his head cocked to one side . * What ? * he asks . * Please don * t be mad at me , * I whisper . * I * m not mad at you. * I stare at him. He sighs . * Yes , I am mad at you. * He closes his eyes briefly . * Palm-twitchingly mad ? * I ask nervously . * What are you two whispering about ? * Kate interjects . I flush , and Christian glares at her in a butt-out-of-this-Kavanagh kind of way.

Kate smiles , a wicked gleam in her eye . * How was Jos * when you went to the bar with him on Friday ? * Holy fuck , Kate. I widen my eyes at her. What is she doing ? She widens her eyes back at me , and I realize she * s trying to make Christian jealous. How little she knows. I thought I * d got away with this . * He was fine , * I murmur . Christian leans over . * Palm-twitchingly mad , * he whispers. * Especially now. * His tone is quiet and deadly . Oh no. I squirm . Grace reappears carrying two plates , followed by a pretty young woman with blond pigtails , dressed smartly in pale blue , carrying a tray of plates. Her eyes immediately find Christian * s in the room. She blushes and gazes at him from under her long mascara-covered lashes. What ? Somewhere in the house the phone starts ringing . * Excuse me. * Mr. Grey rises again and exits . * Thank you , Gretchen , * Grace says gently , frowning as Mr. Grey exits. * Just leave the tray on the console. * Gretchen nods , and with another furtive glance at Christian , she leaves . So the Greys have staff , and the staff are eyeing up my would-be Dominant. Can this evening get any worse ? I scowl at my hands in my lap"
