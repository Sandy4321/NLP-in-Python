"to me . * Yes , ma * am. * He * s trying unsuccessfully to hide his smile . I narrow my eyes at him as I slip the pants on. My hair is a mess , and I know I * ll have to face the Katherine Kavanagh Inquisition after he * s gone. Grabbing a hair tie , I walk to my bedroom door , opening it to check for Kate. She is not in the living room. I think I can hear her on the phone in her room. Christian follows me out. During the short walk from bedroom to front door , my thoughts and feelings ebb and flow , transforming. I * m no longer angry with him , I feel suddenly unbearably shy. I don * t want him to go.

His breathing accelerates. He deepens the kiss , leaning into me. I put my hands on his arms. I want to run them through his hair , but I resist , knowing that he won * t like it. He leans his forehead against mine , his eyes closed , his voice strained . * Anastasia , *"
