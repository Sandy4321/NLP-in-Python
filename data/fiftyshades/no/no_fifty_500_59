"I gasp , completely unaware that I am chewing my bottom lip and my mouth pops open. That has to be the sexiest thing anybody has ever said to me. My heartbeat spikes , and I think I * m panting. Jeez , I * m a quivering , mess , and he hasn * t even touched me. I squirm in my seat and meet his dark glare . * Why don * t you ? * I challenge quietly . * Because I * m not going to touch you , Anastasia * not until I have your written consent to do so. * His lips hint at a smile . What ? * What does that mean ? * * Exactly what I say. * He sighs and shakes his head at me , amused but exasperated , too. * I need to show you , Anastasia. What time do you finish work this evening ? * * About eight. * * Well , we could go to Seattle this evening or next Saturday for dinner at my place , and I * ll acquaint you with the facts then. The choice is yours. * * Why can * t you tell me now ? * * Because I * m enjoying my breakfast and your company. Once you * re enlightened , you probably won * t want to see me again. * What does that mean ? Does he white-slave small children to some godforsaken part of the planet ? Is he part of some underworld crime syndicate ? It would explain why he * s so rich. Is he deeply religious ? Is he impotent ? Surely not * he could prove that to me right now. I flush scarlet thinking about the possibilities. This is getting me nowhere. I * d like to solve the riddle that is Christian Grey sooner rather than later. If it means that whatever secret he has is so gross that I don * t want to know him anymore , then , quite frankly , it will be a relief. Don * t lie to yourself * my subconscious yells at me * it * ll have to be pretty damned bad to have you running for the hills . * Tonight. * He raises an eyebrow . * Like Eve , you * re so quick to eat from the tree of knowledge. * He smirks . * Are you smirking at me , Mr. Grey ? * I ask sweetly. Pompous ass . He narrows his eyes at me and picks up his BlackBerry. He presses one number . * Taylor. I * m going to need Charlie Tango. * Charlie Tango ! Who * s he ? * From Portland at , say , twenty thirty * No , standby at Escala * All night. * All night ! * Yes. On call tomorrow morning. I * ll pilot from Portland to Seattle. *"
