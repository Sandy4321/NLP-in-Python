"trouble ? Blonde Number Two frowns and eyes the young woman at the desk . * Would you like tea , coffee , water ? * she asks , turning her attention back to me . * A glass of water. Thank you , * I murmur . * Olivia , please fetch Miss Steele a glass of water. * Her voice is stern. Olivia scoots up and scurries to a door on the other side of the foyer . * My apologies , Miss Steele , Olivia is our new intern. Please be seated. Mr. Grey will be another five minutes. * Olivia returns with a glass of iced water . * Here you go , Miss Steele. * * Thank you. * Blonde Number Two marches over to the large desk , her heels clicking and echoing on the sandstone floor. She sits down , and they both continue their work . Perhaps Mr. Grey insists on all his employees being blonde. I * m wondering idly if that * s legal , when the office door opens and a tall , elegantly dressed , attractive African American man with short dreads exits. I have definitely worn the wrong clothes . He turns and says through the door , * Golf this week , Grey ? * I don * t hear the reply. He turns , sees me , and smiles , his dark eyes crinkling at the corners. Olivia has jumped up and called the elevator. She seems to excel at jumping from her seat. She * s more nervous than me ! * Good afternoon , ladies , * he says as he departs through the sliding door . * Mr. Grey will see you now , Miss Steele. Do go through , * Blonde Number Two says. I stand rather shakily , trying to suppress my nerves. Gathering up my backpack , I abandon my glass of water and make my way to the partially open door . * You don * t need to knock * just go in. * She smiles kindly . I push open the door and stumble through , tripping over my own feet and falling headfirst into the office . Double crap * me and my two left feet ! I am on my hands and knees in the doorway to Mr. Grey * s office , and gentle hands are around me , helping me to stand. I am so embarrassed , damn my clumsiness. I have to steel myself to glance up. Holy cow * he * s so young . * Miss Kavanagh. * He extends a long-fingered hand to me once I * m upright. * I * m Christian Grey. Are you all right ? Would you like to sit ? * So young * and attractive , very attractive. He * s tall , dressed in a fine gray suit , white shirt , and black tie with unruly dark copper-colored hair"
