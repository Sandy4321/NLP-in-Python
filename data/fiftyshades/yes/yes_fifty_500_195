"consent to be blindfolded ? Does the Submissive consent to be gagged ? * We * ve talked about suspension. And it * s fine if you want to set that up as a hard limit. It takes a great deal of time , and I only have you for short periods of time anyway. Anything else ? * * Don * t laugh at me , but what * s a spreader bar ? * * I promise not to laugh. I * ve apologized twice. * He glares at me. * Don * t make me do it again , * he warns. And I think I visibly shrink * oh , he * s so bossy. * A spreader is a bar with cuffs for ankles and/or wrists. They * re fun. * * Okay * Well , gagging me. I * d be worried I wouldn * t be able to breathe. * * I * d be worried if you couldn * t breathe. I don * t want to suffocate you. * * And how will I use safewords if I * m gagged ? * He pauses . * First of all , I hope you never have to use them.

My brain is beginning to fog * hmm , alcohol . * I * m nervous about the gagging. * * Okay. I * ll take note. * I stare up at him , realization dawning . * Do you like tying your submissives up so they can * t touch you ? * He gazes at me , his eyes widening . * That * s one of the reasons , * he says quietly . * Is that why you * ve tied my hands ? * * Yes. * * You don * t like talking about that , * I murmur . * No , I don * t. Would you like another drink ? It * s making you brave , and I need to know how you feel about pain. * Holy crap * this is the tricky part. He refills my teacup , and I sip . * So , what * s your general attitude to receiving pain ? * Christian looks expectantly at me. * You * re biting your lip , * he says darkly . I stop immediately , but I don * t know what to say. I flush and stare down at my hands . * Were you physically punished as a child ? * * No. * * So you have no sphere of reference at all ? * * No. * * It * s not as bad as you think.
