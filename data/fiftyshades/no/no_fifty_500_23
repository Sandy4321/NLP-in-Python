"from Princeton , where he * s studying business administration. * I * m babbling * Stop now ! * Mr. Clayton. * Grey holds his hand out , his look unreadable . * Mr. Grey. * Paul returns his handshake. * Wait up * not the Christian Grey ? Of Grey Enterprises Holdings ? * Paul goes from surly to awestruck in less than a nanosecond. Grey gives him a polite smile that doesn * t reach his eyes . * Wow * is there anything I can get you ? * * Anastasia has it covered , Mr. Clayton. She * s been very attentive. * His expression is impassive , but his words * it * s like he * s saying something else entirely. It * s baffling . * Cool , * Paul responds. * Catch you later , Ana. * * Sure , Paul. * I watch him disappear toward the stockroom. * Anything else , Mr. Grey ? * * Just these items. * His tone is clipped and cool. Damn * have I offended him ? Taking a deep breath , I turn and head for the register. What is his problem ? I ring up the rope , coveralls , masking tape , and cable ties . * That will be forty-three dollars , please. * I glance up at Grey , and I wish I hadn * t. He * s watching me closely , intently. It * s unnerving . * Would you like a bag ? * I ask as I take his credit card . * Please , Anastasia. * His tongue caresses my name , and my heart once again is frantic. I can hardly breathe. Hurriedly , I place his purchases in a plastic bag . * You * ll call me if you want me to do the photo shoot ? * He * s all business once more. I nod , rendered speechless yet again , and hand back his credit card . * Good. Until tomorrow , perhaps. * He turns to leave , then pauses. * Oh * and Anastasia , I * m glad Miss Kavanagh couldn * t do the interview. * He smiles , then strides with renewed purpose out of the store , slinging the plastic bag over his shoulder , leaving me a quivering mass of raging female hormones. I spend several minutes staring at the closed door through which he * s just left before I return to planet Earth . Okay * I like him. There , I * ve admitted it to myself. I can not hide from my feelings anymore. I * ve never felt like this before. I find him attractive , very attractive. But it * s a lost cause , I know , and I sigh with bittersweet regret. It was just a coincidence , his coming here. But still , I can admire him from afar , surely."
