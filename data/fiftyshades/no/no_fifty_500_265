"Anastasia , I * m delighted that you * ve met my parents. Why are you so filled with self-doubt ? It never ceases to amaze me. You * re such a strong , self-contained young woman , but you have such negative thoughts about yourself. If I hadn * t wanted you to meet them , you wouldn * t be here. Is that how you were feeling the whole time you were there ? * Oh ! He wanted me there * and it * s a revelation. He doesn * t seem uncomfortable answering me as he would if he were hiding the truth. He seems genuinely pleased that I * m here * a warm glow spreads slowly through my veins. He shakes his head and reaches for my hand. I glance nervously at Taylor . * Don * t worry about Taylor. Talk to me. * I shrug . * Yes. I thought that. And another thing , I only mentioned Georgia because Kate was talking about Barbados. I haven * t made up my mind. * * Do you want to go and see your mother ? * * Yes. * He looks oddly at me , like he * s having some internal struggle . * Can I come with you ? * he asks eventually . What ! * Erm * I don * t think that * s a good idea. * * Why not ? * * I was hoping for a break from all this * intensity to try to think things through. * He stares at me . * I * m too intense ? * I burst out laughing. * That * s putting it mildly ! * In the light of the passing street lamps , I see his lips quirk up . * Are you laughing at me , Miss Steele ? * * I wouldn * t dare , Mr. Grey , * I reply with mock seriousness . * I think you dare , and I think you do laugh at me , frequently. * * You are quite funny. * * Funny ? * * Oh yes. * * Funny peculiar or funny ha-ha ? * * Oh * a lot of one and some of the other. * * Which way more ? * * I * ll leave you to figure that out. * * I * m not sure if I can figure anything out around you , Anastasia , * he says sardonically , and then continues quietly , * What do you need to think about in Georgia ? * * Us , * I whisper . He stares at me , impassive . * You said you * d try , * he murmurs . * I know. * * Are you having second thoughts ? * * Possibly. * He shifts as if uncomfortable . * Why ? * Holy crap. How did this suddenly"
