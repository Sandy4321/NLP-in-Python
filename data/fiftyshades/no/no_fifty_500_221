"demeaned , debased , and abused. And much to my mortification , you * re right , I was aroused , and that was unexpected. As you are well aware , all things sexual are new to me * I only wish I was more experienced and therefore more prepared. I was shocked to feel aroused . What really worried me was how I felt afterward. And that * s more difficult to articulate. I was happy that you were happy. I felt relieved that it wasn * t as painful as I thought it would be. And when I was lying in your arms , I felt * sated. But I feel very uncomfortable , guilty even , feeling that way. It doesn * t sit well with me , and I * m confused as a result. Does that answer your question ? I hope the world of Mergers and Acquisitions is as stimulating as ever * and that you weren * t too late . Thank you for staying with me .

I believe it was you who decided on the debasement , if I remember correctly. Do you really feel like this or do you think you ought to feel like this ? Two very different things. If that is how you feel , do you think you could just try to embrace these feelings , deal with them , for me ? That * s what a submissive would do . * I am grateful for your inexperience. I value it , and I * m only beginning to understand what it means. Simply put * it means that you are mine in every way . * Yes , you were aroused , which in turn was very arousing , there * s nothing wrong with that . * Happy does not even begin to cover how I felt. Ecstatic joy comes close . * Punishment spanking hurts far more than sensual spanking * so that * s about as hard as it gets , unless , of course , you commit some major transgression , in which case I * ll use some implement to punish you with. My hand was very sore. But I like that . * I felt sated , too * more so than you could ever know . * Don * t waste your energy on guilt , feelings of wrongdoing , etc. We are consenting adults and what we do behind closed doors is between ourselves.
