"a meal of punishing me. I roll my eyes , knowing full well he can * t see me . He lifts the hem of my bathrobe , and for some reason , this feels more intimate than being naked. He gently caresses my behind , running his warm hand all over both cheeks and down to the tops of my thighs . * I am doing this so that you remember not to run from me , and as exciting as it is , I never want you to run from me , * he whispers . And the irony is not lost on me. I was running to avoid this. If he * d opened his arms , I * d run to him , not away from him . * And you rolled your eyes at me. You know how I feel about that. * Suddenly , it * s gone * that nervous edgy fear in his voice. He * s back from wherever he * s been. I hear it in his tone , in the way he places his fingers on my back , holding me * and the atmosphere in the room changes . I close my eyes , bracing myself for the blow. It comes hard , snapping across my backside , and the bite of the belt is everything I feared. I cry out involuntarily and take a huge gulp of air . * Count , Anastasia ! * he commands . * One ! * I shout at him , and it sounds like an expletive . He hits me again , and the pain pulses and echoes along the line of the belt. Holy shit * that smarts . * Two ! * I scream. It feels so good to scream . His breathing is ragged and harsh , whereas mine is almost nonexistent as I desperately scrabble around my psyche looking for some internal strength. The belt cuts into my flesh again . * Three ! * Tears spring unwelcome into my eyes. Jeez * this is harder than I thought * so much harder than the spanking. He * s not holding anything back . * Four ! * I yell as the belt bites me again , and now the tears are streaming down my face. I don * t want to cry. It angers me that I am crying. He hits me again . * Five. * My voice is more a choked , strangled sob , and in this moment I think I hate him. One more , I can do one more. My backside feels as if it * s on fire . * Six , * I whisper as the blistering pain cuts across me again , and I hear him drop the belt behind me , and he * s pulling me into his arms , all breathless and compassionate * and I want none of him . * Let go"
