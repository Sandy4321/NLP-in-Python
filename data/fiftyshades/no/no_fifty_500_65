"eyes. * Anastasia Steele. * * Hi , Ana ! * Ana ! * Hello , Elliot. * * Heard a lot about you , * Elliot murmurs huskily. Christian frowns . * Don * t believe a word Kate says. * Elliot laughs . * I * m dropping Anastasia off now. * Christian emphasizes my full name. * Shall I pick you up ? * * Sure. * * See you shortly. * Christian hangs up , and the music is back . * Why do you insist on calling me Anastasia ? * * Because it * s your name. * * I prefer Ana. * * Do you now ? * We are almost at my apartment. It * s not taken long . * Anastasia , * he muses. I scowl at him , but he ignores my expression. * What happened in the elevator * it won * t happen again , well , not unless it * s premeditated. * He pulls up outside my duplex. I belatedly realize he * s not asked me where I live * yet he knows. But then he sent the books ; of course he knows where I live. What able , cell phone * tracking , helicopter-owning stalker wouldn * t ? Why won * t he kiss me again ? I pout at the thought. I don * t understand. Honestly , his surname should be Cryptic , not Grey. He climbs out of the car , walking with easy , long-legged grace around to my side to open the door , ever the gentleman * except perhaps in rare , precious moments in elevators. I flush at the memory of his mouth on mine , and the thought that I * d been unable to touch him enters my mind. I wanted to run my fingers through his decadent , untidy hair , but I * d been unable to move my hands. I am retrospectively frustrated . * I liked what happened in the elevator , * I murmur as I climb out of the car. I * m not sure if I hear an audible gasp , but I choose to ignore it and head up the steps to the front door . Kate and Elliot are sitting at our dining table. The fourteen-thousand-dollar books have disappeared. Thank heavens. I have plans for them. She has the most un-Kate-like ridiculous grin on her face , and she looks mussed up in a sexy kind of way. Christian follows me into the living room , and in spite of her I * ve-been-having-a-good-time-all-night grin , Kate eyes him suspiciously . * Hi , Ana. * She leaps up to hug me , then holds me at arm * s length so she can examine me. She frowns and turns to Christian . * Good morning , Christian , * she says , and her tone is a little hostile . * Miss"
