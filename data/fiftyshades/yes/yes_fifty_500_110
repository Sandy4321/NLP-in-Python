"He cries out and stills , and I can feel warm , salty liquid oozing down my throat. I swallow quickly. Ugh * I * m not sure about this. But one look at him , and I don * t care * he * s come apart in the bath because of me. I sit back and watch him , a triumphant , gloating smile tugging at the corners of my lips. His breathing is ragged. Opening his eyes , he glares at me . * Don * t you have a gag reflex ? * he asks , astonished. * Christ , Ana * that was * good , really good. Unexpected , though. * He frowns. * You know , you never cease to amaze me. * I smile and consciously bite my lip. He eyes me speculatively . * Have you done that before ? * * No. * And I can * t help the small tinge of pride in my denial . * Good , * he says complacently and , I think , relieved. * Yet another first , Miss Steele. * He looks appraisingly at me. * Well , you get an A in oral skills. Come , let * s go to bed , I owe you an orgasm. * Orgasm ! Another one ! Quickly , he clambers out of the bath , giving me my first full glimpse of the Adonis , divinely formed , that is Christian Grey. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring , too , openmouthed and drooling slightly. His erection tamed but still substantial * wow. He wraps a small towel around his waist , covering the essentials , and holds out a larger fluffy white towel for me. Climbing out of the bath , I take his proffered hand. He wraps me in the towel , pulls me into his arms , and kisses me hard , pushing his tongue into my mouth. I long to reach around and embrace him * touch him * but he has my arms trapped in the towel. I * m soon lost in his kiss. He cradles my head , his tongue exploring my mouth , and I get a sense he * s expressing his gratitude * maybe * for my first blow job ? Whoa . He pulls away , his hands on either side of my face , staring intently into my eyes. He looks lost . * Say yes , * he whispers fervently . I frown , not understanding . * To what ? * * Yes to our arrangement. To being mine. Please , Ana , * he whispers pleading , emphasizing the last word and my name. He kisses me again , sweetly , passionately , before he stands back and stares at me , blinking slightly. He takes my hand and leads me back to his bedroom , leaving me reeling , so I follow him"
