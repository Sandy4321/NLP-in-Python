"* releases me . * Grey , * he says tersely. I glance anxiously up at Christian. He * s glowering at Jos * , and he * s furious. Crap. My stomach heaves , and I double over , my body no longer able to tolerate the alcohol , and I vomit spectacularly on to the ground . * Ugh * Dios m * o , Ana ! * Jos * jumps back in disgust. Grey grabs my hair and pulls it out of the firing line and gently leads me over to a raised flowerbed on the edge of the parking lot. I note , with deep gratitude , that it * s in relative darkness . * If you * re going to throw up again , do it here. I * ll hold you. * He has one arm around my shoulders * the other is holding my hair in a makeshift ponytail down my back so it * s off my face. I try awkwardly to push him away , but I vomit again * and again. Oh , shit * how long is this going to last ? Even when my stomach * s empty and nothing is coming up , horrible dry heaves rack my body. I vow silently that I * ll never ever drink again. This is just too appalling for words. Finally , it stops . My hands are resting on the brick wall of the flowerbed , barely holding me up. Vomiting profusely is exhausting. Grey takes his hands off me and passes me a handkerchief. Only he would have a monogrammed , freshly laundered linen handkerchief. CTG. I didn * t know you could still buy these. Vaguely I wonder what the T stands for as I wipe my mouth. I can not bring myself to look at him. I * m swamped with shame , disgusted with myself. I want to be swallowed up by the azaleas in the flowerbed and be anywhere but here . Jos * is still hovering by the entrance to the bar , watching us. I groan and put my head in my hands. This has to be the single worst moment of my life. My head is still swimming as I try to remember a worse one * and I can only come up with Christian * s rejection * and this is so , so many shades darker in terms of humiliation. I risk a peek at him. He * s staring down at me , his face composed , giving nothing away. Turning , I glance at Jos * , who looks pretty shamefaced himself and , like me , intimidated by Grey. I glare at him. I have a few choice words for my so-called friend , none of which I can repeat in front of Christian Grey , CEO. Ana , who are you kidding ? He * s just seen you hurl all over the ground"
