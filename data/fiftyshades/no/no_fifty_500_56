", socks , and underwear. Oh my. A clean bra and panties * actually , to describe them in such a mundane , utilitarian way does not do them justice. They are exquisitely designed fancy European lingerie. All pale blue lace and finery. Wow. I am in awe and slightly daunted by this underwear. What * s more , they fit perfectly. But of course they do. I flush to think of Buzz Cut in some lingerie store buying this for me. I wonder what else is in his job description . I dress quickly. The rest of the clothing is a perfect fit. I brusquely towel-dry my hair and try desperately to bring it under control. But , as usual , it refuses to cooperate , and my only option is to restrain it with a hair tie which I don * t have. I should have one in my purse , wherever it is. I take a deep breath. Time to face Mr. Confusing . I * m relieved to find the bedroom empty. I hunt quickly for my purse * but it * s not in here. Taking another deep breath , I enter the living area of the suite. It * s huge. There * s an opulent , plush seating area , all overstuffed couches and soft cushions , an elaborate coffee table with a stack of large glossy books , a study area with the latest-generation iMac , and an enormous plasma screen TV on the wall. Christian is sitting at a dining table on the other side of the room reading a newspaper. It * s the size of a tennis court or something , not that I play tennis , though I have watched Kate a few times. Kate ! * Crap , Kate , * I croak. Christian peers up at me . * She knows you * re here and still alive. I texted Elliot , * he says with just a trace of humor . Oh no. I remember her fervent dancing of the night before. All her patented moves used with maximum effect to seduce Christian * s brother , no less ! What * s she going to think about me being here ? I * ve never stayed out before. She * s still with Elliot. She * s only done this twice before , and both times I * ve had to endure the hideous pink PJs for a week from the fallout. She * s going to think I * ve had a one-night stand , too . Christian stares at me imperiously. He * s wearing a white linen shirt , collar and cuffs undone . * Sit , * he commands , pointing to a place at the table. I make my way across the room and sit down opposite him as I * ve been directed. The table is laden with food . * I didn * t know what you"
