"toward the runway. He and Christian keep up a running conversation. I catch the gist. We will be in a Blanik L-23 , which is apparently better than the L-13 , although this is open to debate. Benson will be flying a Piper Pawnee. He * s been flying tail draggers for about five years now. It all means nothing to me , but glancing up at Christian , he is so animated , so in his element , it * s a pleasure to watch him . The plane itself is long , sleek , and white with orange stripes. It has a small cockpit with two seats , one in front of the other. It * s attached by a long white cable to a small , conventional singlepropeller plane. Benson opens the large , clear Perspex dome that frames the cockpit , allowing us to climb in . * First we need to strap on your parachute. * Parachute ! * I * ll do that , * Christian interrupts him and takes the harness from Benson , who smiles amenably at him . * I * ll fetch some ballast , * Benson says , and heads toward the plane . * You like strapping me into things , * I observe dryly . * Miss Steele , you have no idea. Here , step into the straps. * I do as I * m told , placing my arm on his shoulder. Christian stiffens slightly but doesn * t move. Once my feet are in the loops , he pulls the parachute up , and I place my arms through the shoulder straps. Deftly he fastens the harness and tightens all the straps . * There , you * ll do , * he says mildly , but his eyes are gleaming. * Do you have your hair tie from yesterday ? * I nod . * You want me to put my hair up ? * * Yes. * I quickly do as I * m asked . * In you go , * Christian commands. He * s still so bossy. I go to climb into the back . * No , front. The pilot sits in the back. * * But won * t you be able to see ? * * I * ll see plenty. * He grins . I don * t think I have ever seen him so happy * bossy , but happy. I clamber in , settling down into the leather seat. It is surprisingly comfortable. Christian leans over , pulls the harness over my shoulders , reaches between my legs for the lower belt , and slots it into the fastener that rests against my belly. He tightens all the restraining straps . * Hmm , twice in one morning , I am a lucky man , * he whispers , and kisses me quickly. * This won * t take long * twenty ,"
