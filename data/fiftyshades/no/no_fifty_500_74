"ease his way gracefully to the door of the helicopter and open it. He jumps out , waiting for me to follow , and takes my hand as I clamber down on to the helipad. It * s very windy on top of the building , and I * m nervous about the fact that I * m standing at least thirty stories high in an unenclosed space. Christian wraps his arm around my waist , pulling me tightly against him . * Come , * he shouts above the noise of the wind. He drags me over to an elevator and , after tapping a number into a keypad , the doors open. It * s warm inside and all mirrored glass. I can see Christian to infinity everywhere I look , and the wonderful thing is he * s holding me to infinity , too. Christian taps another code into the keypad , then the doors close and the elevator descends . Moments later , we * re in an all-white foyer. In the middle is a round , dark wood table , and on it is an unbelievably huge bunch of white flowers. On the walls there are paintings everywhere. He opens a set of double doors , and the white theme continues across a wide corridor where directly opposite , is the entrance to a palatial room. It * s the main living area , double height. * Huge * is too small a word for it. The far wall is glass and leads onto a balcony that overlooks Seattle . To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably. It faces a state-of-the-art stainless-steel * or maybe platinum , for all I know * modern fireplace. The fire is lit and flaming gently. On the left beside us , by the entry way , is the kitchen area. All white with dark wood worktops and a breakfast bar that seats six . Near the kitchen area , in front of the glass wall , is a dining table surrounded by sixteen chairs. And tucked in the corner is a full-sized , shiny black grand piano. Oh yes * he probably plays the piano , too. There is art of all shapes and sizes on all the walls. In fact , this apartment looks more like a gallery than a place to live . * Can I take your jacket ? * Christian asks. I shake my head. I * m still cold from the wind on the helipad . * Would you like a drink ? * he asks. I blink at him. After last night ! Is he trying to be funny ? For one second , I think about asking for a margarita * but I don * t have the nerve . * I * m going to have a glass of white wine. Would you like to join me ? * * Yes , please ,"
