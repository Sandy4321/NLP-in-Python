"is. Today , at this point in our strange arrangement , you don * t need my permission to use it. * He can not hide his irritation. He shrugs out of his shirt , and I scoot into the bathroom . I stare at myself in the over-large mirror , shocked that I still look the same. After all that I * ve done today , it * s still the same ordinary girl gaping back at me. What did you expect * that you * d grow horns and a little pointy tail ? my subconscious snaps at me. And what the hell are you doing ? Touching is his hard limit. Too soon , you idiot. He needs to walk before he can run. My subconscious is furious , Medusa-like in her anger , hair flying , her hands clenched around her face like in Edvard Munch * s The Scream. I ignore her , but she won * t climb back into her box. You are making him mad * think about all that * s he * s said , all he * s conceded. I scowl at my reflection. I need to be able to show him affection * then perhaps he can reciprocate . I shake my head , resigned , and grasp Christian * s toothbrush. My subconscious is right , of course. I * m rushing him. He * s not ready and neither am I. We are balanced on the delicate seesaw that is our strange arrangement * at different ends , vacillating , and it tips and sways between us. We both need to edge closer to the middle. I just hope neither of us falls off in our attempt to do so. This is all so quick. Maybe I need some distance. Georgia seems more appealing than ever. As I begin brushing my teeth , he knocks . * Come in , * I splutter through a mouthful of toothpaste . Christian stands in the doorway , his PJs hanging off his hips in that way that makes every little cell in my body stand up and take notice. He * s bare-chested , and I drink him in like I * m crazed with thirst and he * s clear , cool mountain spring water. He gazes at me impassively , then smirks and comes to stand beside me. Our eyes lock in the mirror , gray to blue. I finish with his toothbrush , rinse it off , and hand it to him , my look never leaving his. Wordlessly , he takes the toothbrush from me and puts it in his mouth. I smirk back at him , and his eyes are suddenly dancing with humor . * Do feel free to borrow my toothbrush. * His tone is gently mocking . * Thank you , Sir , * I smile sweetly , and I leave , heading back to bed .
