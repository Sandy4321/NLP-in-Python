"biting your lip , * he breathes. * You know what that does to me , * he adds darkly. * Turn around. * I turn immediately , no hesitation. He unclasps my bra and then , taking both straps , he slowly pulls it down my arms , brushing my skin with his fingers and the tip of his thumbnails as he slides my bra off. His touch sends shivers down my spine , waking every nerve ending in my body. He * s standing behind me , so close that I feel the heat radiating from him , warming me , warming me all over. He pulls my hair so it * s all hanging down my back , grasps a handful at my nape , and angles my head to one side. He runs his nose down my exposed neck , inhaling all the way , then back up to my ear. The muscles in my belly clench , carnal and wanting. Jeez , he * s hardly touched me , and I want him . * You smell as divine as ever , Anastasia , * he whispers as he places a soft kiss beneath my ear . I moan . * Quiet , * he breathes. * Don * t make a sound. * Pulling my hair behind me , to my surprise , he starts braiding it in one large braid , his fingers fast and deft. He ties it with an unseen hair tie when he * s finished and gives it a quick tug so I * m forced back against him . * I like your hair braided in here , * he whispers . Hmm * why ? He releases my hair . * Turn around , * he orders . I do as I * m bid , my breathing shallow , fear and longing mixed together. It * s an intoxicating mix . * When I tell you to come in here , this is how you will dress. Just in your panties. Do you understand ? * * Yes. * * Yes , what ? * He glowers at me . * Yes , Sir. * A trace of a smile lifts the corner of his mouth . * Good girl. * His eyes burn into mine. * When I tell you to come in here , I expect you to kneel over there. * He points to a spot beside the door. * Do it now. * I blink , processing his words , then turn and rather clumsily kneel as directed . * You can sit back on your heels. * I sit back . * Place your hands and forearms flat on your thighs. Good. Now part your knees. Wider. Wider. Perfect. Look down at the floor. * He walks over to me , and I can see his feet and shins in my field of vision. Naked feet. I should be taking notes"
