"become such an intense and meaningful conversation ? It * s been sprung on me , like an exam that I * m not prepared for. What do I say ? Because I think I love you , and you just see me as a toy. Because I can * t touch you , because I * m too frightened to show you any affection in case you flinch or tell me off or worse * beat me ? What can I say ? I stare momentarily out of the window. The car is heading back across the bridge. We are both shrouded in darkness , masking our thoughts and feelings , but we don * t need the night for that . * Why , Anastasia ? * Christian presses me for an answer . I shrug , trapped.

And that * s my cue. I unbuckle my seatbelt , reach across , and clamber into his lap , taking him completely by surprise. Wrapping my arms around his head , I kiss him , long and hard , and in a nanosecond , he * s responding . * Stay with"
