"the strength , I * d touch him , but I don * t. Belatedly , I realize he * s still wearing his jeans . * Well done , baby , * he murmurs. * Did that hurt ? * * No , * I breathe. I can barely keep my eyes open. Why am I so tired ? * Did you expect it to ? * he whispers as he holds me close , his fingers pushing some escaped tendrils of hair off my face . * Yes. * * You see , most of your fear is in your head , Anastasia. * He pauses. * Would you do it again ? * I think for a moment as fatigue clouds my brain * Again ? * Yes. * My voice is so soft . He hugs me tightly . * Good. So would I , * he murmurs , then leans down and softly kisses the top of my head . * And I haven * t finished with you yet. * Not finished with me yet. Holy Moses. There * s no way I can do any more. I am utterly spent and fighting an overwhelming desire to sleep. I * m leaning against his chest , my eyes are closed , and he * s wrapped around me * arms and legs * and I feel * safe , and oh so comfortable. Will he let me sleep , perchance to dream ? My mouth quirks up at the silly thought , and turning my face into Christian * s chest , I inhale his unique scent and nuzzle him , but immediately he tenses * oh crap. I open my eyes and glance up at him. He * s staring down at me . * Don * t , * he breathes in warning . I flush and look back at his chest in longing. I want to run my tongue through the hair , kiss him , and for the first time , I notice he has a few random and faint small , round scars dotted around his chest. Chicken pox ? Measles ? I think absently . * Kneel by the door , * he orders as he sits back , putting his hands on his knees , effectively releasing me. No longer warm , the temperature of his voice has dropped several degrees . I stumble clumsily up into a standing position and scoot over to the door and kneel as instructed. I * m shaky and very , very tired , monumentally confused. Who would have thought I could have found such gratification in this room. Who could have thought it would be so exhausting ? My limbs are deliciously heavy , sated. My inner goddess has a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the outside of her room . Christian is moving about in the periphery of my vision. My eyes start to droop . * Boring you"
