"inebriated state , I am shocked. She * s only just met him. She nods at whatever Elliot says and grins at me and waves. Christian propels us off the dance floor in double time . But I never got to talk to her. Is she okay ? I can see where things are heading for her and him. I need to do the safe-sex lecture. In the back of my mind , I hope she reads one of the posters on the inside of the bathroom door. My thoughts crash through my brain , fighting the drunk , fuzzy feeling. It * s so warm in here , so loud , so colorful * too bright. My head begins to swim , oh no * and I can feel the floor coming up to meet my face , or so it feels.

Control freak that he is , he thinks of everything. I sit up and take the tablets. Actually , I don * t feel that bad , probably much better than I deserve. The orange juice tastes divine. It * s thirst-quenching and refreshing . There * s a knock on the door. My heart leaps into my mouth , and I can * t seem to find my voice. He opens the door anyway and strolls in . Holy hell , he * s been working out. He * s in gray sweatpants that hang"
