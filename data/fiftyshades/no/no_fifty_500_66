"Kavanagh , * he says in his stiff , formal way . * Christian , her name is Kate , * Elliot grumbles . * Kate. * Christian gives her a polite nod and glares at Elliot , who grins and rises to hug me , too . * Hi , Ana. * He smiles , his blue eyes twinkling , and I like him immediately. He * s obviously nothing like Christian , but then they * re adopted brothers . * Hi , Elliot. * I smile at him , and I * m aware that I * m biting my lip . * Elliot , we * d better go , * Christian says mildly . * Sure. * He turns to Kate and pulls her into his arms and gives her a long , lingering kiss . Jeez * get a room. I stare at my feet , embarrassed. I glance up at Christian , and he * s watching me intently. I narrow my eyes at him. Why can * t you kiss me like that ? Elliot continues to kiss Kate , sweeping her off her feet and dipping her in a dramatic hold so that her hair touches the ground as he kisses her hard . * Laters , baby. * He grins . Kate just melts. I * ve never seen her melt before * the words * comely * and * compliant * come to mind. Compliant Kate. Boy , Elliot must be good. Christian rolls his eyes and stares down at me , his expression unreadable , although maybe he * s mildly amused. He tucks a stray strand of my hair that has worked its way free from my ponytail behind my ear. My breath hitches at the contact , and I lean my head into his fingers. His eyes soften , and he runs his thumb across my lower lip. My blood sears in my veins. And all too quickly , his touch is gone . * Laters , baby , * he murmurs , and I have to laugh because it * s so unlike him. But even though I know he * s being irreverent , the endearment tugs at something deep inside me . * I * ll pick you up at eight. * He turns to leave , opening the front door and stepping out onto the porch. Elliot follows him to the car but turns and blows Kate another kiss , and I feel an unwelcome pang of jealousy . * So , did you ? * Kate asks as we watch them climb into the car and drive off , the burning curiosity evident in her voice . * No , * I snap irritably , hoping that will halt the questions. We head back into the apartment. * You obviously did , though. * I can * t contain my envy. Kate always manages to ensnare men. She is irresistible ,"
