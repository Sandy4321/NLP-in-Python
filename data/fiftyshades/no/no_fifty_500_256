". Mr. Grey returns . * Call for you , darling. It * s the hospital , * he says to Grace . * Please start , everyone. * Grace smiles as she hands me a plate and leaves . It smells delicious * chorizo and scallops with roasted red peppers and shallots , sprinkled with flat-leaf parsley. And in spite of the fact that my stomach is churning from Christian * s veiled threats , the surreptitious glances from pretty little Miss Pigtails , and the debacle of my missing underwear , I am starving. I flush as I realize it * s the physical effort of this afternoon that * s given me such an appetite . Moments later Grace returns , her brow furrowed. Mr. Grey cocks his head to one side * like Christian . * Everything okay ? * * Another measles case. * Grace sighs . * Oh no. * * Yes , a child. The fourth case this month. If only people would get their kids vaccinated. * She shakes her head sadly , and then smiles. * I * m so glad our children never went through that. They never caught anything worse than chicken pox , thank goodness. Poor Elliot , * she says as she sits down , smiling indulgently at her son. Elliot frowns mid-chew and squirms uncomfortably. * Christian and Mia were lucky. They got it so mildly , only a spot to share between them. * Mia giggles , and Christian rolls his eyes . * So , did you catch the Mariners game , Dad ? * Elliot * s clearly keen to move the conversation on . The hors d * oeuvres are delicious , and I concentrate on eating while Elliot , Mr. Grey , and Christian talk baseball. Christian seems relaxed and calm talking to his family. My mind is working furiously. Damn Kate , what game is she playing ? Will he punish me ? I quail at the thought. I haven * t signed that contract yet. Perhaps I won * t. Perhaps I * ll stay in Georgia where he can * t reach me . * How are you settling into your new apartment , dear ? * Grace asks politely . I * m grateful for her question , distracting me from my discordant thoughts , and I tell her about our move . As we finish our starters , Gretchen appears , and not for the first time , I wish I felt able to put my hands freely on Christian just to let her know * he may be fifty shades of fucked up , but he * s mine. She proceeds to clear the table , brushing rather too closely to Christian for my liking. Fortunately , he seems oblivious to her , but my inner goddess is smoldering and not in a good way . Kate and Mia are waxing lyrical about Paris ."
