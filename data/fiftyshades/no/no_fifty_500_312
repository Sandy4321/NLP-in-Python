"* s so nice to hear someone use your full name. * * Beautiful name for a beautiful girl , * Christian murmurs , shaking her outstretched hand , and she actually simpers . Oh , Mom * et tu , Brute ? I stand , gazing up at him , imploring him to answer my question , and he kisses my cheek chastely . * Laters , baby , * he whispers in my ear. Then he * s gone . Damned control freak bastard. My anger returns in full force. I slump into my chair and turn to face my mother . * Well , strike me down with a feather , Ana. He * s a catch. I don * t know what * s going on between you two though. I think you need to talk to each other. Phew * the UST in here , it * s unbearable. * She fans herself theatrically . * MOM ! * * Go talk to him. * * I can * t. I came here to see you. * * Ana , you came here because you * re confused about that boy. It * s obvious you two are crazy about each other. You need to talk to him. He * s just flown three-thousand-odd miles to see you , for heaven * s sake. And you know how awful it is to fly. * I flush. I haven * t told her about his private plane . * What ? * she snaps . * He has his own plane , * I mumble , embarrassed , * and it * s only two and a half thousand miles , Mom. * Why am I embarrassed ? Her eyebrows shoot up . * Wow , * she mutters. * Ana , there * s something going on between you two. I * ve been trying to fathom it since you arrived here. But the only way you are going to sort the problem , whatever it is , is to talk it through with him. You can do all the thinking you like * but until you actually talk , you * re not going to get anywhere. * I frown at my mother . * Ana , honey , you * ve always had a tendency to overanalyze everything. Go with your gut. What does that tell you , sweetheart ? * I stare at my fingers . * I think I * m in love with him , * I mutter . * I know darling. And he with you. * * No ! * * Yes , Ana. Hell * what do you need ? A neon sign flashing on his forehead ? * I gape at her and tears prick the corner of my eyes . * Ana , darling. Don * t cry. * * I don * t think he loves me. * * I don * t care"
