"me Tess of the d * Urbervilles specifically ? * I ask. Christian stares at me for a moment. I think he * s surprised by my question . * Well , you said you liked Thomas Hardy. * * Is that the only reason ? * Even I can hear the disappointment in my voice. His mouth presses into a hard line . * It seemed appropriate. I could hold you to some impossibly high ideal like Angel Clare or debase you completely like Alec d * Urberville , * he murmurs , and his eyes flash dark and dangerous . * If there are only two choices , I * ll take the debasement. * I whisper , gazing at him.

I * ll sign. * He hands me a pen . * Aren * t you even going to read it ? * * No. * He frowns . * Anastasia , you should always read anything you sign , * he admonishes me . * Christian , what you fail to understand is that I wouldn * t talk about us to anyone anyway. Even Kate. So it * s immaterial whether I sign an agreement or not. If it means so much to you , or your lawyer * whom you obviously talk to , then fine. I * ll sign. * He gazes down at me , and he nods gravely . * Fair point well made , Miss Steele. * I lavishly sign on the dotted line of both copies and hand one back to him. Folding the other , I place it my purse and take"
