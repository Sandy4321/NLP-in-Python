"gazes down at me. * Welcome back , Miss Steele , * he whispers and , clasping my chin , he leans down and proffers a gentle , light kiss on my lips. The touch of his lips to mine reverberates throughout my body. My breath hitches . * Hi , * I whisper as I flush . * You * re on time. I like punctual. Come. * He takes my hand and leads me to the couch. * I wanted to show you something , * he says as we sit. He hands me the Seattle Times. On page eight , there * s a photograph of the two of us together at the graduation ceremony. Holy crap. I * m in the paper. I check the caption .

I * d forgotten . * What can you tell me about Dr. Greene ? * I ask to distract us both . * She * s the best ob-gyn in Seattle. What more can I say ? * He shrugs . * I thought I was seeing your doctor , and don * t tell me you * re really a woman , because I won * t believe you. * He gives me a don * t-be-ridiculous look . * I think it * s more appropriate that you see a specialist.
