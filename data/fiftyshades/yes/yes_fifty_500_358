", and his face hardens perceptibly . * What are the safewords , Anastasia ? * he says slowly and deliberately . * * Yellow , * * I mumble . * And ? * he prompts , his mouth setting in a hard line . * * Red , * * I breathe . * Remember those. * And I can * t help it * I raise my eyebrow at him and am about to remind him of my GPA , but the sudden frosty glint in his icy gray eyes stops me in my tracks . * Don * t start with your smart mouth in here , Miss Steele.
