"and into the local flora. There * s no disguising your lack of ladylike behavior . * I * ll , er * see you inside , * Jos * mutters , but we both ignore him , and he slinks off back into the building. I * m on my own with Grey. Double crap. What should I say to him ? Apologize for the phone call . * I * m sorry , * I mutter , staring at the handkerchief , which I am furiously worrying with my fingers. It * s so soft . * What are you sorry for , Anastasia ? * Damn it , he wants his damned pound of flesh . * The phone call , mainly. Being sick. Oh , the list is endless , * I murmur , feeling my skin coloring up. Please , please , can I die now ? * We * ve all been here , perhaps not quite as dramatically as you , * he says dryly. * It * s about knowing your limits , Anastasia. I mean , I * m all for pushing limits , but really this is beyond the pale. Do you make a habit of this kind of behavior ? * My head buzzes with excess alcohol and irritation. What the hell has it got to do with him ? I didn * t invite him here. He sounds like a middle-aged man scolding me like an errant child. Part of me wants to say that if I want to get drunk every night like this , then it * s my decision and nothing to do with him * but I * m not brave enough. Not now that I * ve thrown up in front of him. Why is he still standing there ? * No , * I say contritely. * I * ve never been drunk before and right now I have no desire to ever be again. * I just don * t understand why he * s here. I begin to feel faint. He notices my dizziness and grabs me before I fall and hoists me into his arms , holding me close to his chest like a child . * Come on , I * ll take you home , * he murmurs . * I need to tell Kate. * I * m in his arms again . * My brother can tell her. * * What ? * * My brother Elliot is talking to Miss Kavanagh. * * Oh ? * I don * t understand . * He was with me when you phoned. * * In Seattle ? * I * m confused . * No , I * m staying at the Heathman. * Still ? Why ? * How did you find me ? * * I tracked your cell phone , Anastasia. * Oh , of course he did. How is that possible ?"
