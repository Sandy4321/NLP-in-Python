"don * t like the way I am. * He stares at me , bewildered again. * I think you * re lovely the way you are. * * So why are you trying to change me ? * * I don * t want to change you. I * d like you to be courteous and to follow the set of rules I * ve given you and not defy me. Simple , * he says . * But you want to punish me ? * * Yes , I do. * * That * s what I don * t understand. * He sighs and runs his hands through his hair again . * It * s the way I * m made , Anastasia.

So , you felt confused ? * I squirm under his intense gaze . * You have no problem being honest with me in print. Your e-mails always tell me exactly how you feel. Why can * t you do that in conversation ? Do I intimidate you that much ? * I pick at an imaginary spot on my mother * s blue-and-cream quilt . * You beguile"
