"hand in his. Holy crap , this could be it. I follow him meekly down the grand stairs and into the lobby , my scalp prickling , my blood pumping. This could be the last good-bye if I decide to say no. My heart contracts painfully in my chest. What a turnaround. What a difference a moment of clarity can make to a girl . * Do you have your valet ticket ? * I fish into my clutch purse and hand him the ticket , which he gives to the doorman. I peek up at him as we stand waiting . * Thank you for dinner , * I murmur . * It * s a pleasure as always , Miss Steele , * he says politely , though he looks deep in thought , completely distracted . As I peer up at him , I commit his beautiful profile to memory. The idea that I might not see him again haunts me , unwelcome and too painful to contemplate. He turns suddenly , staring down at me , his expression intense . * You * re moving this weekend to Seattle. If you make the right decision , can I see you on Sunday ? * He sounds hesitant . * We * ll see. Maybe , * I breathe. Momentarily , he looks relieved , and then he frowns . * It * s cooler now , don * t you have a jacket ? * * No. * He shakes his head in irritation and takes off his jacket . * Here. I don * t want you catching cold. * I blink up at him as he holds it open , and as I hold my arms out behind me , I * m reminded of the time in his office when he slipped my coat onto my shoulders * the first time I met him * and the effect he had on me then. Nothing * s changed ; in fact , it * s more intense. His jacket is warm , far too big , and it smells of him. * delicious . My car pulls up outside. Christian * s mouth drops open . * That * s what you drive ? * He * s appalled. Taking my hand , he leads me outside. The valet jumps out and hands me my keys , and Christian coolly palms him some money . * Is this roadworthy ? * He * s glaring at me now . * Yes. * * Will it make it to Seattle ? * * Yes. She will. * * Safely ? * * Yes , * I snap , exasperated. * Okay , she * s old. But she * s mine , and she * s roadworthy. My stepdad bought it for me. * * Oh , Anastasia , I think we can do better than this. * * What do you mean ? *"
